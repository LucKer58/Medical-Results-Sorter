The primary outcomes measured \nincluded trends in WTP thresholds, funding sources, types of interventions and \ndisease classifications.\nRESULTS: A total of 82 US-based CEAs met the inclusion criteria. All studies \nassessed outcomes in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). WTP thresholds of \nUS$50 000 (41%) and US$100 000 (39%) were most frequently reported, with US$150 \n000 emerging in 9% of studies since 2019. Discounting at 3.0% for costs and \nQALYs was universally applied. Government (33%), nonprofit (29%) and \npharmaceutical (17%) funding predominated. Pharmaceutical-funded studies often \nemployed higher WTP thresholds of US$100 000 (29%) and US$150 000 (29%). The \nmost common intervention types were surgical (40%) and pharmaceutical (40%), \nwhereas diseases of the choroid and retina (43%) were most frequently studied. \nHealthcare perspectives (17 studies) were more commonly reported than societal \nperspectives (6 studies).\nCONCLUSIONS: US-based ophthalmology CEAs commonly use US$50 000-$100 000 WTP \nthresholds and a 3.0% discount rate, with higher thresholds emerging recently. \nPublic and nonprofit funding predominates, focusing on retinal diseases and \nsurgical or pharmaceutical interventions. Reassessing fixed WTP thresholds and \nincorporating societal perspectives could improve CEAs' relevance, ensuring \nalignment with evolving economic and healthcare landscapes.\n\n\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

This study aims to compare the effectiveness of \nteaching methods-real cases, artificial intelligence (AI)-generated images, and \nreal medical images-on improving medical students' diagnostic accuracy of \nbacterial, fungal, and herpetic keratitis.\nMETHODS: 97 consecutive fourth-year medical students who had completed basic \nophthalmology educational courses were included. The students were divided into \nthree groups: 30 students in the group (G1) using the real cases for teaching, \n37 students in the group (G2) using AI-generated images for teaching, and 30 \nstudents in the group (G3) using real medical images for teaching. The G1 group \nhad a 1-hour study session using five real cases of each type of infectious \nkeratitis. The G2 group and the G3 group each experienced a 1-hour image reading \nsessions using 50 AI-generated or real medical images of each type of infectious \nkeratitis. Diagnostic accuracy for three types of infectious keratitis was \nassessed via a 30-question test using real patient images, compared before and \nafter teaching interventions.\nRESULTS: All teaching methods significantly improved mean overall diagnostic \naccuracy. The mean accuracy improved from 42.03 to 67.47% in the G1 group, from \n42.68 to 71.27% in the G2 group, and from 46.50 to 74.23% in the G3 group, \nrespectively. The mean accuracy improvement was highest in the G2 group \n(28.43%). There were no statistically significant differences in mean accuracy \nor accuracy improvement among the 3 groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: AI-generated images significantly enhance the diagnostic accuracy \nfor infectious keratitis in medical students, performing comparably to \ntraditional case-based teaching and real patient images. This method may \nstandardize and improve clinical ophthalmology training, particularly for \nconditions with limited educational resources.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

This disparity grows with increasing academic rank, resulting in the \nloss of professionals within academic medical institutions. The purpose of the \npresent study is to investigate gender disparity in the Academy of Ophthalmology \nin Japan. A retrospective observational study was conducted. The number of the \nfirst presenters and moderators in 24 of the Japanese academic congresses held \nin 2023 was assessed. Data of the first presenters and moderators were collected \nfrom the website or abstract book of each congress. Gender and the nationality \n(Japanese or non-Japanese) of the first presenters and moderators were estimated \nfrom their given names and photographs. The study comprised 1325 (25.2%) women \nand 3933 (74.8%) men across all congresses. Among them, 1116 (27.2%) of the \nfirst presenters and 209 (18.0%) of the moderators were women. When the sessions \nwere classified into 4 categories as nominated/guest/special lectures, award \nlectures, symposium/instruction/educational lectures, and free paper/posters, \nfemale representation was 24.5%, 20.7%, 20.9%, and 31.4% among first presenters, \nand 17.0%, 11.4%, 16.3%, and 21.6% among moderators, respectively. The \npercentage of non-Japanese first presenters was 1.3% in women and 1.4% in men, \nand 2.4% and 0.0% in the moderators, respectively. The participation rate of \nwomen and non-Japanese individuals in the academic congresses of ophthalmology \nin Japan is remarkably low. In contrast, Japanese men account for the majority \nof participants, highlighting a significant imbalance. This suggests a lack of \ndiversity within the society's membership.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 the Author(s).

This technique \nprovides valuable insights into the cornea's hydration state and anisotropic \nbiomechanics, improving our understanding of its intrinsic characteristics. \nNumerous studies have demonstrated the diagnostic potential of Brillouin \nmicroscopy for corneal diseases. Experimental research has also shown \nsignificant changes in Brillouin biomechanics properties following procedures \nlike corneal flap formation and corneal cross-linking. Additionally, Brillouin \nmicroscopy offers a novel perspective on age-related changes in both Brillouin \nbiomechanics and morphology of crystalline lenses. Successful Brillouin \nmeasurements have been performed on other ocular tissues, including the limbus, \nsclera, and retina, in ex vivo studies.\nCONCLUSIONS: Brillouin microscopy holds great promise as an ophthalmology tool. \nIt offers unique insights into the biomechanical properties, disease-related \nalterations in ocular tissues, and intrinsic characteristics of biological \nspecimens. The application of stimulated Brillouin microscopy, along with the \nintegration of laser pump and machine learning techniques, can further enhance \nthe acquisition speed and resolution of biological imaging.

With \nan estimated 38.4 million Americans diagnosed with DM, the disease exerts a \nsignificant burden on healthcare systems, especially in rural areas where access \nto care is limited. DR prevalence is notably higher in rural communities due to \nbarriers such as geographical isolation, lower socioeconomic status, and \nprovider shortages.\nOBJECTIVE: This narrative review explores the current state of DR management in \nrural areas, highlighting the increased incidence of the condition in these \nregions and the unique challenges faced by rural patients.\nBARRIERS TO CARE: Key barriers to care include distance and travel, financial \nconstraints, and a lack of ophthalmology and optometry specialists.\nSOLUTIONS: The review also discusses potential solutions to improve DR outcomes, \nincluding teleophthalmology, artificial intelligence (AI) screening, and \nexpanding rural healthcare workforce programs. These interventions aim to \nimprove early detection and access to treatment, ultimately reducing the \ndisparity in DR care between rural and urban populations. Comprehensive efforts \nfrom policymakers, healthcare systems, and educational institutions will be \ncrucial in addressing the gaps in rural DR care and improving patient outcomes.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/07853890.2025.2522323\nPMCID: PMC12231324\nPMID: 40613644 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: No potential conflict of interest was reported \nby the author(s).\n\n\n7.

The \ndriving force behind these acquisitions is the potential for high returns \nthrough operational efficiencies, increased bargaining power with insurers, and \naccess to lucrative outpatient procedures. However, PE's impact on the quality \nand cost of ophthalmic care remains unclear. Studies show mixed results: some \nreport increased use of expensive treatments and higher costs, while others \nsuggest minimal changes in patient outcomes or spending. PE's appeal to \nophthalmologists includes capital infusion for practice expansion and improved \nrisk management, though concerns exist over profit-driven incentives possibly \ncompromising patient care. The market for ophthalmology practices remains \nfragmented, with PE firms capitalizing on consolidation opportunities. Despite \nthe growth, there are challenges to assessing the full impact of PE involvement, \nparticularly due to limited research, nondisclosure agreements, and difficulty \nin selecting control practices for comparison. While PE acquisitions have been \naccelerating, recent reports indicate a slowdown in 2024, influenced by factors \nsuch as interest rates and federal investigations into the health care sector. \nThe future of PE in ophthalmology will likely depend on market conditions, \nregulatory changes, and further research into its long-term effects on care \nquality and physician autonomy.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The article compares the detection of eye conditions by health \nprofessionals using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) with AI abilities.\nREVIEW METHODS: Online databases were searched for articles discussing the \neffectiveness of AI in OCT analyses and assessment of the accuracy and agreement \nof AI algorithms with human experts. Key words included 'OCT', 'AI', \n'comparison' and 'effectiveness''.\nRESULTS: AI algorithms have demonstrated the capability to automatically segment \nretinal layers, detect and quantify pathological changes, and predict disease \nprogression. The application of AI helps address the challenge of artifacts in \nOCT images, enhancing the accuracy of tissue structure segmentation and \nimproving diagnostic precision.\nCONCLUSIONS: This article explores the comparative effectiveness of AI and human \nexperts in diagnosing ocular conditions using OCT, highlighting AI's potential \nto complement human expertise and improve patient outcomes. Despite the \npromising results, variability in AI performance across different studies \nunderscores the need for more robust and standardized AI models, along with \nhigh-quality, diverse datasets to ensure consistent and generalizable results.\n\nDOI: 10.26444/aaem/195109\nPMID: 40586515 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n12.

The matching algorithm, \nGale-Shapley, has been relatively unchanged for over 50 years, and although it \nresults in a stable solution for the match, where no applicant and program would \nprefer to be matched together than to their assigned match, it does not optimize \nthe overall match result.\nOBJECTIVE: To compare the performance of a mixed-integer linear \noptimization-based approach, the residency optimizer, for matching and against \nthe currently used Gale-Shapley algorithm.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This quality improvement study used \nanonymized rank lists and match data for ophthalmology residency matches \nconducted between 2011 to 2021. The Gale-Shapley algorithm and the residency \noptimizer were compared for overall performance for both applicants and \nprograms, under both unlimited choice rank lists and capitated lists. The \nalgorithms were also compared for couple matching. Final data analyses were \nperformed in April 2025.\nEXPOSURE: Matching with an ophthalmology residency and fellowship.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Algorithm performance was compared in terms of mean \nmatched rank of applicants and programs, as well as the percentage of applicants \nmatching their top 3 ranked programs. For the capped rank list experiments, the \npercentage of positions filled and the percentage of applicants matching their \ntop choices were measured. For couple matching, the percentage of couples \nmatched was computed.\nRESULTS: For a total of 6990 applicants (635.5 applicants per year) and a mean \nof 114.6 programs per year from 2011 to 2021, applicants matched 0.45 rank \npositions better (2.40 using the optimized algorithm vs 2.85 using \nGale-Shapley), and the program matched applicants 0.32 rank positions better \n(2.65 for the optimized algorithm vs 2.97 for Gale-Shapley) per position under \nresidency optimizer match than under Gale-Shapley. In total, 78.4% of applicants \n(4079 of 5200 applicants) matched to 1 of their top 3 choices with the residency \noptimizer match compared with 70.9% (3668 of 5174 applicants) with the \nGale-Shapley algorithm. The residency optimizer eliminated unfilled residency \npositions and resulted in a mean of 2.4 fewer programs with unfilled slots \nannually. The residency optimizer outperformed the Gale-Shapley algorithm with \ntruncated match lists and outperformed Gale-Shapley in successfully matching \ncouples.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that alternate match \nalgorithms optimizing global utility may generally improve residency and \nfellowship match outcomes.\n\nDOI: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.17077\nPMCID: PMC12186513\nPMID: 40549382 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr C.

In this study, a consanguineous Chinese family with USH, including \ntwo affected individuals and five unaffected individuals, was recruited. All \nsubjects received an ophthalmic examination and an auditory examination. The two \nUSH patients exhibited severe early-onset hearing and vision loss. DNA samples \nfrom the two USH patients were analyzed using whole-exome sequencing. A novel \nhomozygous frameshift mutation (NM_206933.4:c.6379_6380delinsC, p.G2127Pfs\u221725) \nin USH2A, resulting in a truncated USH2A protein lacking 3051 amino acids, was \nidentified in the proband. In addition, novel compound mutations in USH2A (one \nallele harboring NM_206933.4:c.9958G>T, p.G3320C; NM_206933.4:c.8284C>G, \np.P2762A; and the other NM_206933.4:c.6379_6380delinsC; p.G2127Pfs\u221725) were \nidentified in the other affected individual. In silico analysis predicts that \nwhile the p.G3320C mutation has little impact on the local structure around the \nmutation site, the p.P2762A substitution may alter the protein's interaction \nwith its binding partners. In addition, p.G2127Pfs\u221725 causes a truncation of a \nmajor portion of the protein that severely disrupts the protein structure and \nresults in the loss of its function. In conclusion, this study identified novel \nUSH mutations in USH2A and expanded the spectrum of disease-associated variants \nin the USH2A gene, which will promote the molecular screening of genetic \nmutations in USH patients.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Haolin Wang et al.

Dual sensory defects, \nseveral metabolic and hormonal dysfunctions are frequent in ALMS. Increased \nmusculoskeletal deformities have been observed, though these aspects have not \nbeen systematically reviewed. This study characterises the anthropometric, \nclinical, genetic and imaging features of bone deformities in a large UK cohort \nwith ALMS and describes the details of first documented successful corrective \nsurgery for scoliosis.\nMETHODS: A preliminary study of 13 Alstr\u00f6m patients was\u00a0undertaken to evaluate \nmusculoskeletal deformities. Written consent was obtained after sharing of study \ninformation via voice mail or Braille. Questionnaires, clinical examination and \nradiological evaluations were\u00a0conducted\u00a0twice 12\u00a0months apart by a \nrheumatologist and an\u00a0orthopaedic surgeon. Two patients had scoliosis which \nrequired intervention. To discover its prevalence, 42 further AS patients were \nreviewed. All patients attended the Alstom syndrome UK specialist clinics.\nRESULTS: In the detailed survey of 13 patients, all had some degree of \nmusculoskeletal deformities, most commonly partially correctable thoracic \nkyphosis, brachydactyly, femoral anteversion and pes planus but rarely affecting \ntheir daily functioning. In the larger group of 55 patients, 6 had scoliosis \nrequiring intervention; two of whom had spinal deformity requiring surgical \ncorrection in adolescence, and one had cervical spine surgery for spondylitis.\nCONCLUSION: ALMS patients tend to have high prevalence of musculoskeletal \ndeformities which may be part of the ciliopathy. Postural adaptation to dual \nsensory loss resulted in correctable kyphosis, treatable by physiotherapy. \nScoliosis requiring intervention is frequent (10.9%), with successful surgery \nundertaken where indicated.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

The diagnosis of PDR relies \nprimarily on imaging features and blood glucose levels. Whether early biomarkers \nin other biofluid applied in the evaluation of PDR and RNV remain elusive. In \ntotal, 40 Chinese type-2 diabetes with DR and 21 non-diabetic subjects were \nrecruited. Tear glycometabolic profiles and glycometabolite levels were \ncomprehensively analyzed using both untargeted and targeted metabolomics \napproaches. Additionally, we employed multivariable logistic regression models, \nPearson correlation analysis, receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), \nretinal non-perfusion area detection and choroid sprouting assay to evaluate and \nvalidate the association between tear metabolites and PDR. Our metabolomic \nanalysis revealed significantly elevated levels of metabolites related to the \nTCA cycle as well as D-glutamine and D-glutamate pathway in PDR subjects \ncompared to non-diabetic controls. Among these metabolites, the fasting tear \nlactate was the highest in PDR subjects relative to other tear monosaccharides. \nNotably, tear lactate emerged as an independent risk factor for PDR, achieving \nan area under the curve (AUC) of 0.896 in predictive modeling. Furthermore, the \ntear lactate was validated to have effect on RNV.

This review summarizes the clinical presentation, diagnostic \nchallenges, and therapeutic strategies for cardiac involvement in BS.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Advanced imaging techniques have revealed subclinical cardiac \ninvolvement in BS. Myocardial dysfunction and fibrosis contribute to heart \nfailure and arrhythmias, while intracardiac thrombi often coexist with pulmonary \nartery involvement. Coronary artery vasculitis and aneurysms may mimic \natherosclerotic disease, complicating diagnosis. Biologic therapies, including \nTNF-\u03b1 inhibitors, show promise in refractory cases. Early diagnosis and \nimmunosuppressive therapy are crucial. A multidisciplinary approach is essential \nto managing cardiac complications and optimizing patient outcomes. Future \nresearch should refine screening protocols and explore targeted immunotherapies \nfor BS-related cardiovascular disease.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

All were managed at a \nsingle tertiary eye care centre in India. Patients underwent corneal scrapings; \nanterior chamber taps or vitreous taps. Data reviewed included age, gender, \nonset of symptoms, examination findings, laboratory work up and the different \nmanagement outcomes. Anatomical success was assessed in terms of globe integrity \nand functional success in terms of visual acuity.\nRESULTS: The median interval to onset of symptoms after cataract surgery was \n11.5\u00a0days (mean, 20.6\u00a0days; range, 1-90\u00a0days). Corneal infiltrates with \nendophthalmitis were present in 87.5%(14/16) of eyes. Microbiological work up \nrevealed 53.3% positivity (8/15 patients); Candida glabrata (n\u2009=\u20091), Aspergillus \nfumigatus (n\u2009=\u20094), and the PCR pan-fungal genome (n\u2009=\u20093). No sample was taken in \none patient given the nature of intrastromal infiltrates. Various management \nstrategies were followed according to algorithm recommended by the authors. The \ninfection resolved in 86.67% (13/15) patients, while one patient lost to follow \nup. The mean time of resolution of infiltrates was 9.7\u00a0weeks (15 patients). The \nfinal visual acuity was 20/200 in 3 patients, 20/60 in 2 patients and 20/40 in 8 \npatients; while 2 patients progressed to phthisis.\nCONCLUSION: Post-cataract surgery, fungal tunnel infections are a diagnostic as \nwell as therapeutic challenge. A systematic management algorithm needs to be \nfollowed for a successful outcome.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Among these, epiretinal prostheses have shown \nencouraging preliminary clinical efficacy; however, optimizing stimulation \nparameters remains essential for improving efficiency and reducing power \nconsumption. In this study, we investigated the effects of key electrical \nstimulation parameters- phase duration, frequency, and interphase interval (IPI) \n-on visual cortical electrically evoked potentials (EEPs) in both healthy \nLong-Evans (LE) rats and retinal degenerated (F1) rats. Our in vivo experiments \non both LE and F1 rats revealed that shorter phase durations (500 \u00b5s) elicited \nactivation in the primary visual cortex (V1) at lower charge thresholds. Our \nresults also showed that responses to repetitive stimulation were significantly \nattenuated at high frequencies (10 and 20\u00a0Hz) compared to low frequency \nstimulation (1\u00a0Hz). Furthermore, we observed that longer phase durations (1000 \nand 1500 \u00b5s), as well as the inclusion of an IPI, resulted in a more confined \nspread of cortical activation. These findings suggest that adjusting phase \nduration can effectively reduce activation thresholds and spatially constrain \ncortical responses, and application of IPI can limit the extension of cortical \nresponses, offering a potential strategy for enhancing the performance of \nepiretinal prostheses.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Infection can affect any part of the orbit but postseptal \ninvolvement most frequently justifies imaging requests, due to its potential \nseverity and associated complications. The differential diagnosis of acute \norbital pathology is broad and includes not only infectious entities but also \ninflammatory and neoplastic conditions. It is important to know how to recognise \nthese entities in order to establish early treatment and avoid serious \ncomplications.

Corneal edema has been \ndocumented among mice experiments conducted onboard the Space Transportation \nSystem mission, STS-133, owing to increased stress response gene expression.\nMETHODS: A targeted, relevant search of the literature on topics relating to \nocular surface and spaceflight was conducted with scholarly databases PubMed, \nWeb of Science, and Embase from inception to July 2024.\nRESULTS: From our search results we identified 12,742 articles, 485 of which met \nthe scope of our initial literature search criteria. Following refinement, 99 \narticles were included in our review paper. The most frequently mentioned \nmechanisms of corneal edema related to spaceflight included contact lens related \nhypoxia (24%). Regarding treatments for corneal edema, surgical grafts (16.9%) \nwere most common. From our data, central corneal thickness measurements in \nastronauts with prior refractive surgery showed no significant differences pre- \nand postflight: right eye mean preflight, 492 \u00b5m vs. postflight, 493.3 \u00b5m; left \neye, 499 \u00b5m pre- and postflight.\nDISCUSSION: This knowledge may contribute to our understanding of the increased \nrisk of ocular surface symptoms reported among astronauts. This review discusses \nthe current literature on corneal endothelial transport physiology and the \ndetriments of corneal edema to astronaut visual function. We also describe the \ndiagnostic modalities we can apply to spaceflight, such as anterior segment \noptical coherence tomography, and offer convenient countermeasures to \nspaceflight-related ocular surface anomalies. In doing so, we aim to make future \nmissions safer for human exploration. Lee R, Ong J, Sampige R, Panzo N, Memon H, \nSuh A, Waisberg E, Mader T, Berdahl J, Ch\u00e9vez-Barrios P, Lee AG.

Primary care-based diabetic retinopathy \nscreening could improve access, but operational challenges, such as cost and \nworkflow management, hamper the widespread adoption of retinal camera systems in \nprimary care clinics in the United States.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and evaluate a retinal screening system \nsuitable for integration into a primary care workflow.\nMETHODS: We developed a nonmydriatic, 45\u00b0 field imaging retinal camera system, \nthe Verily Numetric Retinal Camera (VNRC; Verily Life Sciences LLC), able to \ngenerate high-fidelity retinal images enabled by on-device intelligent features. \nThe VNRC output flows into cloud-based software that accepts and routes \ndigitized images for grading. We evaluated the performance and usability of the \nVNRC in 2 studies. A retrospective performance study compared the performance of \nVNRC against a reference camera (Crystalvue NFC-700 [Crystalvue Medical]) as \nwell as the correlation between VNRC capture status and gradability (as \ndetermined by ophthalmologist graders). The usability study simulated a primary \ncare setting for a combined cohort of trained and untrained users (corresponding \nto patients in the simulation) and operators (corresponding to health care \npersonnel in the simulation), where respondents completed a questionnaire about \ntheir user experience after attempting to capture images with the VNRC.\nRESULTS: In the comparative performance study (N=108, K=206 images), a total of \n98.5% (203/206) of images captured by the VNRC were graded as sufficient for \nclinical interpretation compared to 97.1% (200/206) of Crystalvue NFC-700 images \n(difference in proportion was 0.015, 95% CI -0.007 to 0.033). In the quality \ncontrol algorithm evaluation (N=172, K=343 images), we found a positive \nassociation (\u03c6=0.58, 95% CI 0.45-0.69) between gradability status (gradable or \nnongradable) as determined by ophthalmologists and the capture status (recapture \nnot-needed or needed) as determined by the VNRC quality control algorithm. In \nthe usability study (n=15 users and n=30 operators), all participating users \n(15/15) indicated that they were able to have both eyes screened easily. Most \nusers and operators indicated agreement (from somewhat agree to strongly agree) \nwith statements describing the imaging process as intuitive (15/15, 100% and \n29/30, 97%), comfortable (15/15, 100% and 30/30, 100%), and allowing for a \npositive experience (15/15, 100% and 30/30, 100%), of users and operators, \nrespectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings about the performance and usability of this retinal \ncamera system support its deployment as an integrated end-to-end retinal service \nfor primary care. These results warrant additional studies to fully characterize \nreal-world usability across a wider and diverse set of primary care clinics.\n\n\u00a9 Matthew Silvestrini, Clarissa Lui, Anil Patwardhan, Ying Chen, Tayyeba Ali, \nElie Glik, Honglei Wu, Brian Levinstein, Adrianna Wenz, Nathan Shemonski, Lin \nYang, Ian Atkinson, Sam Kavusi.

The \npreprocessing algorithm, based on a rotating bounding box detection framework, \nwas trained and evaluated using precision, recall, and mean average precision \n(mAP) at various intersections over union thresholds. A 5-fold cross-validation \nwas performed on an inpatient dataset, with additional testing on an independent \noutpatient dataset and an external cross-population dataset of 500 images from \nthe IMDB-WIKI collection, representing diverse ethnicities and ages. Expert \nvalidation confirmed alignment with clinical standards across 96 images (48 \nimages from a Chinese dataset of patients with strabismus and 48 images from \nIMDB-WIKI). Gradient-weighted class activation mapping heatmaps were used to \nassess model interpretability. A control experiment with 5 optometry specialists \ncompared manual and automated cropping efficiency. Downstream task validation \ninvolved preprocessing 1000 primary gaze photographs using the Dlib toolkit, \nfaster region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN; both without head tilt \ncorrection), and our model (with correction), evaluating the impact of head tilt \ncorrection via the vision transformer strabismus screening network through \n5-fold cross-validation.\nRESULTS: The model achieved exceptional performance across datasets: on the \n5-fold cross-validation set, it recorded a mean precision of 1.000 (95% CI \n1.000-1.000), recall of 1.000 (95% CI 1.000-1.000), mAP50 of 0.995 (95% CI \n0.995-0.995), and mAP95 of 0.893 (95% CI 0.870-0.918); on the internal \nindependent test set, precision and recall were 1.000, with mAP50 of 0.995 and \nmAP95 of 0.801; and on the external cross-population test set, precision and \nrecall were 1.000, with mAP50 of 0.937 and mAP95 of 0.792. The control \nexperiment reduced image preparation time from 10 hours for manual cropping of \n900 photos to 30 seconds with the automated model. Downstream strabismus \nscreening task validation showed our model (with head tilt correction) achieving \nan area under the curve of 0.917 (95% CI 0.901-0.933), surpassing Dlib-toolkit \nand faster R-CNN (both without head tilt correction) with an area under the \ncurve of 0.856 (P=.02) and 0.884 (P=.05), respectively. Heatmaps highlighted \ncore ocular focus, aligning with head tilt directions.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study delivers an AI-driven platform featuring a preprocessing \nalgorithm that automates eye region cropping, correcting head tilt variations to \nimprove image quality for AI development and clinical use. Integrated with \nelectronic archives and patient-physician interaction, it enhances workflow \nefficiency, ensures telemedicine privacy, and supports ophthalmological research \nand strabismus care.\n\n\u00a9 Dawen Wu, Yanfei Li, Zeyi Yang, Teng Yin, Xiaohang Chen, Jingyu Liu, Wenyi \nShang, Bin Xie, Guoyuan Yang, Haixian Zhang, Longqian Liu.

However, measurement noise in dMRI data often \ncompromises the signal quality. Several denoising methods for dMRI have been \nproposed, but the extent to which denoising affects tractometry metrics of white \nmatter tissue properties associated with disorders remains unclear. We evaluated \nhow denoising affects tractometry along the optic tract (OT) in patients with \nglaucoma. Because glaucoma damages retinal ganglion cells, the OT in patients \nwith glaucoma is likely to exhibit tissue abnormalities. Therefore, we examined \ndMRI data from patients with glaucoma to evaluate how two widely used denoising \nmethods (MPPCA and Patch2Self) affect tractometry metrics regarding the expected \ntissue changes in the OT. We found that denoising affected the appearance of \ndiffusion-weighted images, increased the estimated signal-to-noise ratio, and \nreduced residuals in voxelwise model fitting. However, denoising had a limited \nimpact on the differences in tractometry metrics of the OT between patients with \nglaucoma and controls. Moreover, we found no evidence that denoising improved \nthe reproducibility of tractometry. These findings suggest that the current \ndenoising methods have a limited impact when used together with a tractometry \nframework.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Using large-scale genome-wide \nassociation study (GWAS) data, we performed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) \nlevel analysis to detect pleiotropic variants and loci, paired eQTL mapping \nanalysis and gene-level analysis to identify candidate pleiotropic genes. In \naddition, Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis was performed to assess causal \nassociations.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We used POAG GWAS data from Finngen (9565 cases and \n430\u2009250 controls) and T2D GWAS data from 55\u2009555 European ancestry samples. We \nused Linkage Disequilibrium SCore (LDSC) regression to assess the genetic \nassociation between T2D and POAG and further used PLeiotropic Analysis under the \nCOmposite null hypothesis (PLACO) to identify shared genetic variants between \npaired traits. Finally, we further used MR analysis to explore the causal \nassociation between T2D and POAG at the genetic level.\nRESULTS: The LDSC results and MR analysis revealed that the T2D effect was \nsignificantly higher than that of the POAG (OR=1.09, 95%\u2009CI 1.03 to 1.14, \np=1.50\u00d710-3). The PLACO property analysis determined that the T2D sum POAG \nshared 178 individual SNPs, separate localisation of 79 individual causes. The \nfive most popular choices are based on the effectiveness of CCND2, SVEP1, \nST6GAL1, TCF7L2 and HMGA2. expression quantitative trait loci mapping further \nrevealed 36 genes with regulatory roles in optic nerve-related brain tissues. \nFunctional enrichment analyses indicated that these pleiotropic genes are \ninvolved in neurodevelopmental, neuroprotective and metabolic pathways, with \ntissue-specific enrichment observed in neural, pancreatic, adipose and retinal \ntissues. It is possible to present the main comorbid mechanisms of T2D and POAG.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study provides new insights into the aetiology and pathogenesis \nof T2D and POAG at the genetic level.\n\n\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

He was initially misdiagnosed with \nangle-closure glaucoma at a local hospital.\nDIAGNOSES: Upon detailed gonioscopy examination, we observed that the patient's \nanterior chamber angle remained open, albeit with significant pigmentation \npresent. Therefore, the diagnosis of pigment dispersion glaucoma should be \nrevised.\nINTERVENTIONS: To effectively manage intraocular pressure (IOP) and prevent \nprogressive optic nerve damage in the left eye, we performed Kahook dual blade \nab-interno trabeculectomy.\nOUTCOMES: The IOP of left eye ranged from 10 to 16\u2009mm Hg 1 month after operation \nwhile 14\u2009mm Hg at 1 year postoperatively without any antiglaucoma medication, in \ncontrast to preoperative IOP levels that ranged from 25 to 29\u2009mm Hg while 2 \ndifferent antiglaucoma medications applied. Additionally, both visual acuity and \nvisual field remained unchanged compared to preoperative.\nLESSONS: The application of gonioscopy to accurately assess the angle status is \ncrucial in the diagnosis and management of glaucoma. Furthermore, it is \nimperative to give due attention to potential late onset postoperative \ncomplications following ICL implantation.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 the Author(s).

This study integrates epidemiological and bioinformatics approaches to \ninvestigate their relationship, aiming to identify common molecular pathways and \nvalidate clinical correlations. Epidemiological data from 3,015 participants in \nthe CHARLS database were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression and Cox \nproportional hazards models to assess the association between COVID-19 and POAG, \nwith stratification by gender, smoking status, and alcohol consumption. \nConcurrently, gene expression datasets from GEO (POAG: GSE27276; COVID-19: \nGSE171110, GSE152418) were used to identify 57 crosstalk genes (CGs) via \ndifferential expression analysis. Machine learning algorithms (LASSO, SVM-RFE, \nRandom Forest) were applied to screen POAG diagnostic biomarkers from CGs, \nfollowed by construction of transcription factor (TF)-microRNA \n(miRNA)-protein-compound regulatory networks and consensus clustering to \ncharacterize COVID-19 immune microenvironment subtypes. Epidemiological analyses \nrevealed that COVID-19 was an independent risk factor for POAG, with adjusted \nodds ratios (ORs) of 12.775-15.688 and hazard ratios (HRs) of 4.893-5.060 (all \nP\u2009<\u20090.001), with stronger associations in males (OR\u2009=\u200915.054, HR\u2009=\u20095.645) and \nsmokers (OR\u2009=\u200929.828, HR\u2009=\u20099.323). HDL levels were significantly higher in POAG \npatients (P\u2009=\u20090.028), while vb001_s1 positivity was negatively associated with \nPOAG (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Bioinformatics identified CGs enriched in inflammatory \nresponse, oxidative stress, and hypoxia pathways. Five potential biomarkers \n(CA12, ECRG4, CEBPD, HBB, HBA2) showed high diagnostic efficacy (AUC\u2009>\u20090.9) but \nlimited specificity (expressed in uveitis and diabetic retinopathy). COVID-19 \npatients were stratified into three clusters, with Cluster B exhibiting \nhyperactive immune microenvironments characterized by elevated HLA class I/II \nand immune checkpoint genes (CTLA4, PDCD1LG2) in antigen-presenting cells and T \ncells. This study provides epidemiological and molecular evidence linking POAG \nto COVID-19, highlighting inflammation and immune dysregulation as shared \nmechanisms. Gender and smoking modify this association, warranting targeted POAG \nscreening in male COVID-19 survivors and smokers. While identified biomarkers \nrequire specificity improvement, findings underscore the need for mechanistic \nstudies (e.g., ACE2-mediated ocular injury, T-cell neuroinflammation) to \nvalidate causality and inform clinical management.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

However, current in vitro models for OAG-like changes \nin TM cells do not explicitly incorporate mtDNA damage. This work validated two \nmethods of mtDNA damage in immortalized TM cells and assessed OAG-associated \nexpression changes. mtDNA was depleted in TM-1 cells via both ethidium bromide \n(EtBr) treatment and doxycycline (Dox) induction of a mutant (Y147A) version of \nUracil DNA Glycosylase 1 (UNG1) in TM-1 cells (TM-1rtTAadv-TRE-UNG1Y147A). \nLevels of mitochondrial proteins (ATP5F1A, COXII, and COXIV) were measured via \nwestern blot. mtDNA levels and mRNA for OAG-associated transcripts (CTGF, FN1, \nPAI1, and SFRP1) were measured by qPCR. There was a statistically significant \ndecrease in mtDNA levels per cell at all treatment times in both EtBr-treated \nTM-1 cells and induced TM-1rtTAadv-TRE-UNG1Y147A cells. Protein levels of \nATP5F1A were not significantly changed; COXII and COXIV showed significant \ndecreases after both EtBr and Dox induction. Both models resulted in \nupregulation of CTGF, FN1, and PAI1; additionally, EtBr treatment but not Dox \ninduction resulted in SFRP1 upregulation. In conclusion, two models of \nmitochondrial depletion were demonstrated in immortalized TM cells; damage was \nassociated with increases in OAG-associated transcripts, supporting a link \nbetween mitochondrial damage and glaucoma phenotypes.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/ijms26136255\nPMCID: PMC12250015\nPMID: 40650044 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflicts of interest.\n\n\n30.

Primary open-angle glaucoma patients undergoing \nsurgery for uncontrolled intraocular pressure (IOP) at Seoul St. Mary's Hospital \nwere included. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) assessed VD \nchanges in the LC and PPS one month post-surgery. VF progression was evaluated \nusing mean deviation (MD) values from serial VF tests over six months. Of 80 \nenrolled eyes, 74 were analyzed. Laminar VD recovery occurred in 12 eyes \n(16.2%), with a 21.92%\u2009\u00b1\u20097.37% increase, linked to shorter axial length \n(P\u2009=\u20090.005), thinner corneal thickness (P\u2009=\u20090.016), and less PPS VD change \n(P\u2009<\u20090.001). PPS VD recovery occurred in 14 eyes (18.9%), with an 18.50%\u2009\u00b1\u20097.28% \nincrease, associated with younger age (P\u2009=\u20090.043), longer axial length \n(P\u2009=\u20090.010), and lower preoperative PPS VD (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Multivariate analysis \nshowed that both laminar and PPS VD recovery significantly reduced VF \nprogression risk (P\u2009<\u20090.001). VD recovery, particularly in the LC, predicts \nbetter glaucoma outcomes. The distinct responses of LC and PPS to IOP reduction \nhighlight the need to consider individual anatomical factors in glaucoma \nmanagement.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Here, we prospectively examined changes in hyperemia from before to 3 \nmonths after the initiation of the omidenepag isopropyl, a selective \nE-prostanoid receptor-2 receptor agonist, using hyperemia analysis software. \nSubjects were glaucoma patients who started omidenepag isopropyl use at \nHiroshima University Hospital and Saneikai Tsukazaki Hospital. Hyperemia was \ncompared by calculating the percentage coverage of vessels on the apex side \nusing hyperemia analysis software based on anterior segment images. A total of \n45 patients were enrolled, with 19 eyes in the new administration treatment \ngroup and 26 eyes in the group switched from F-prostanoid receptor agonists. \nFollowing switching from F-prostanoid receptor agonists to omidenepag isopropyl, \nthere was no significant change in the hyperemia area from 7.4 (5.7-8.8) % to \n7.4 (5.3-8.3)% (P\u2009=\u20090.53, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). In the new administration \ngroup, the hyperemia area increased significantly from7.0 (5.2-8.6) % to 8.2 \n(6.4-9.1) % (P\u2009=\u20090.02, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). There was no significant \nchange in intraocular pressure (IOP) from 15.0 (12.0-17.0) mmHg to 14.0 \n(12.0-15.0) mmHg in the switching group (P\u2009=\u20090.37, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), \nwhereas there was a significant IOP reduction from 15.0 (13.5-18.5) mmHg to 15.0 \n(11.0-16.5) mmHg (P\u2009=\u20090.03, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) in the new administration \ngroup. One eye in the new administration group that developed macular edema \nduring the observation period resolved spontaneously upon discontinuing \nomidenepag isopropyl.

To characterize current AGV use, a subset of 156 \neyes that underwent surgery in the past five years was analyzed. Clinical \nvariables, including age, gender, glaucoma type, intraocular pressure (IOP), \nIOP-lowering medications, and visual field status, were collected from patients \naged\u2009\u2265\u200918\u00a0years. Temporal trends, surgical indications, and their evolution were \nexamined.\nRESULTS: A total of 519 AGV implantations were included. AGV utilization \nincreased from 15.2% of all glaucoma surgeries in 2010 to 27.5% in 2019 but \nsignificantly declined thereafter, reaching 6.9% in 2022 (p\u2009=\u20090.001). Among the \n156 eyes in the recent subset, 93 had refractory glaucoma, which showed the most \npronounced decline in AGV procedures and the poorest surgical outcomes. Eyes \nwith sulcus-placed or aphakic lenses, uveitis, or neovascular glaucoma \nexperienced a less marked reduction in AGV implantation rates. These cases \npresented with higher baseline IOP but exhibited less glaucomatous damage and a \nbetter response to AGV implantation.\nCONCLUSION: AGV implantation has significantly declined over the past five \nyears, particularly in refractory glaucoma. This trend may be attributed to the \nincreased adoption of subconjunctival bleb-forming surgeries and to the impact \nof the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this overall decline, AGV continues to be \nprimarily employed in cases of secondary glaucoma.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

The \nvalidated Arabic translation of the 39-item National Eye Institute Visual \nFunction Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-39) was used to measure VRQoL. Multivariate \nlinear regression analyses were performed to examine the factors associated with \nVRQoL.\nRESULTS: A total of 454 adult glaucoma patients participated in this study \n(response rate = 97.6%). The mean age of the patients was 60.8 \u00b1 15.0 years. \nMost patients had severe glaucoma (42.5%), were female (54.2%), married (67.8%), \nunemployed (55.3%), had an income level of less than 10,000 Saudi Riyals per \nmonth (35.9%) and approximately one-third had lower secondary education (32.8%). \nA total of 24.4% of participants reported needing a care assistant, and 31.9% \nlived with caregivers. The mean overall composite score on the NEI VFQ-39 was \n71.0 \u00b1 21.3.

The neuroprotective and anti-neuroinflammatory \neffect of Bacteroides fragilis (B. fragilis) and IAA was assessed in both \nmicrobead-induced ocular hypertension mice model and in vitro BV-2 microglial \ncell inflammation model via immunofluorescence, qPCR, Western blot and mice \nbehavioral assays. To explore the underlying mechanisms, retinal transcriptomics \nand microglia-neuron co-cultures were also employed.\nRESULT: Glaucoma patients exhibited gut dysbiosis characterized by depleted \ntryptophan-metabolizing bacteria (B. fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, \nAnaerostipes hadrus) and reduced serum IAA levels. Mice receiving FMT from \nglaucoma patients exhibited lower systemic IAA levels. In in vivo and in vitro \nmodels, B. fragilis or IAA restored AhR activation, suppressed inflammation by \ninhibiting microglial activation and the release of pro-inflammatory mediators \nthroughout the retina, reduced retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) loss and preserved \nvisual function. Mechanistically, IAA attenuated RAGE/NF-\u03baB pathway activation \nvia AhR-dependent signaling, conferring neuroprotection.\nCONCLUSION: Our study proposes a novel AhR-mediated gut microbiota-eye axis in \nglaucoma pathogenesis and demonstrates that IAA serves as an effective \nneuroprotective strategy with clinical potential for managing RGCs \nneurodegeneration.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

This meta-analysis evaluates the diagnostic \nperformance of ic-VEP in glaucoma detection.\nMETHODS: The study protocol was prospectively registered in the International \nProspective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (Registration ID: \nCRD42025633065) prior to data extraction. Following PRISMA guidelines, a \nsystematic search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, Ovid Medline, and \nCochrane databases was conducted from inception to January 1, 2025. Studies \nevaluating ic-VEP for glaucoma diagnosis were included, with confirmed cases \ndefined by standard automated perimetry (SAP). Eligible studies underwent \nmethodological quality was appraised using the QUADAS-2 tool and Review Manager \n5.3. Meta-analysis was conducted using Meta-Disc 1.4 and Stata 13.0 based on the \nhierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) model to derive \npooled sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the \ncurve (AUC). Publication bias was assessed using Deek's funnel plot asymmetry \ntest and trim-and-fill analysis. Heterogeneity was quantified via the I2 \nstatistic, with meta-regression identifying potential sources of variability.\nRESULTS: Ten studies comprising 434 patients with glaucoma and 321 healthy \ncontrols met the inclusion criteria. Pooled sensitivity and specificity for \nglaucoma diagnosis were 0.77 (95% CI: 0.71-0.82) and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.80-0.98), \nwith an AUC 0.86 (95% CI: 0.83-0.89). The DOR was 44.96 (95% CI: 15.25-132.51) \nand the lambda value was 3.70 (95% CI: 2.73-4.66). Both Deek's funnel plot \nasymmetry test (p\u2009=\u20090.30) and trim-and-fill analysis (imputed studies\u2009=\u20094) \ndemonstrated no substantial publication bias. Meta-regression identified type of \ndevice (Neucodia vs. EvokeDx) and type of glaucoma (early POAG vs. others) as \ncontributors to heterogeneity.\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite limited included studies and sample sizes, ic-VEP exhibits \nhigh diagnostic accuracy for glaucoma, offering advantages such as objectivity, \nnon-invasiveness, and operational simplicity. These findings support its \nintegration into clinical workflows for glaucoma screening and diagnosis.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent mRNA internal \nmodification and has been shown to play important roles in regulating the \ndevelopment, physiology, and pathology of various organs and tissues. However, \nthe function of m6A during lens development remains unknown. The purpose of this \nstudy was to investigate the function of Mettl3, the core catalytic component of \nthe m6A-writer complex, during lens development.\nMETHODS: Lens-specific Mettl3 conditional knockout (Mettl3-CKO) mice were used \nas a model to investigate the function of Mettl3 during lens development. \nHematoxylin and eosin staining was used to examine lens histology. \nImmunofluorescence (IF) staining was used to examine the expression of genes in \nthe lenses. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to characterize the transcriptome \nof the lenses. Modified m6A sequencing was used to characterize the m6A \nepitranscriptome of the lenses.\nRESULTS: Mettl3-CKO mice developed cataracts; histologic and IF examination \nrevealed that Mettl3-CKO lenses presented defects in several secondary fiber \ndifferentiation processes, including delayed cell cycle exit, mislocalization, \nand failed cell body elongation. RNA-seq revealed that the expression of genes \nregulating actin-cytoskeleton dynamics and cell cycle progression was altered in \nMettl3-CKO lenses. m6A-seq characterized the lens m6A epitranscriptome and \nsuggested its potential role in regulating fiber cell differentiation processes.\nCONCLUSIONS: Mettl3 regulates lens development by promoting the cell cycle exit \nand cell morphological changes during secondary lens fiber differentiation.\n\nDOI: 10.1167/iovs.66.9.45\nPMID: 40662889 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n37.

Although cataract blindness is reversible, its service coverage \nremains poor, particularly in rural and hilly areas of Nepal. The study aimed to \nevaluate visual outcomes of outreach cataract surgeries and associated \nintraoperative and post-operative complications.\nMETHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted at a district of Eastern Nepal \nafter ethical clearance was taken from the Institutional Review Committee \n(Reference number: 88). Total 131 subjects had cataract surgeries at the \nsurgical camp, and their pre-operative, one-day and one-month post-operative \nvisual acuities were compared, and intraoperative and post-operative surgical \ncomplications were recorded. Visual acuity \u2265 6/12 was considered normal. Data \nwas collected in excel and analyzed in SPSS.\nRESULTS: The mean age of participants was 71.8 \u00b1 9.51 years, with 70 (53.43%) \nmale. A total of 156 eyes from 131 subjects underwent cataract surgeries and \namong them 25 (19.08%) cases underwent bilateral cataract surgeries. At the day \none of surgery, visual acuity improved to normal in 137 (87.82%) of cases, while \nafter one-month, visual acuity improved to normal in 150 (96.15%) of cases with \nbest-corrected glasses. There were 4 (2.56%) intraoperative complications, which \nincluded surgery-induced subluxated bag, premature entry, iris trauma, and \nposterior capsule rent.\nCONCLUSIONS: The visual and surgical outcomes of cataract surgeries performed at \nan outreach surgical camp were excellent with minimal surgical complications.\n\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.\n\nDOI: 10.31729/jnma.8798\nPMCID: PMC11931336\nPMID: 40656808 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no competing interests.\n\n\n38.

Early diagnosis is crucial, as delayed treatment may \nresult in irreversible vision loss. This study explores and presents a mobile \napplication for Android devices designed for the detection of cataracts using \ndeep learning models. The proposed solution utilizes a multi-stage \nclassification approach to analyze ocular images acquired with a slit lamp, \nsourced from the Nuclear Cataract Database for Biomedical and Machine Learning \nApplications. The process involves identifying pathological features and \nassessing the severity of the detected condition, enabling comprehensive \ncharacterization of the NC (nuclear cataract) of cataract progression based on \nthe LOCS III scale classification. The evaluation included a range of \nconvolutional neural network architectures, from larger models like VGG16 and \nResNet50, to lighter alternatives such as VGG11, ResNet18, MobileNetV2, and \nEfficientNet-B0. All models demonstrated comparable performance, with \nclassification accuracies exceeding 91-94.5%. The trained models were optimized \nfor mobile deployment, enabling real-time analysis of eye images captured with \nthe device camera or selected from local storage. The presented mobile \napplication, trained and validated on authentic clinician-labeled pictures, \nrepresents a significant advancement over existing mobile tools. The preliminary \nevaluations demonstrated a high accuracy in cataract detection and severity \ngrading. These results confirm the approach is feasible and will serve as the \nfoundation for ongoing development and extensions.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/s25133954\nPMCID: PMC12252290\nPMID: 40648211 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflicts of interest. \nThe funders had no role in the design of the study; in the collection, analysis, \nor interpretation of data; in the writing of the manuscript; or in the decision \nto publish the results.\n\n\n39.

This retrospective study included patients with grade 2 cataracts \nbetween January and July 2022. Photopic ERGs were recorded using the HE-2000 \nsystem in mydriatic eyes with a 3\u00a0cd\u00b7s/m2 flashing stimulus and in non-mydriatic \neyes using the non-mydriatic mode with a 10\u00a0cd\u00b7s/m2 stimulus. Amplitudes and \nimplicit times of the a-wave, b-wave, and flicker ERG were compared using the \nWilcoxon signed-rank test. Correlations between these parameters were analyzed \nusing Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. In 54 eyes of 27 participants, \nthe b-wave and flicker ERG amplitudes were lower in non-dilated eyes compared to \ndilated ones, with prolonged implicit times observed in non-dilated eyes \n(p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Despite these differences, both b-wave and flicker ERG amplitudes \nand implicit times showed strong correlations between dilated and non-dilated \neyes (p\u2009<\u20090.01). However, the a-wave amplitude was more variable and less \nconsistently measurable in non-dilated eyes. The HE-2000 system can provide \nclinically useful ERG recordings in non-dilated eyes, particularly for b-wave \nand flicker responses. Further validation under non-mydriatic conditions is \nrequired to establish its broader clinical utility.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

We aimed to \ninvestigate the factors influencing preoperative CCT and changes in CCT after \ncataract surgery.\nMETHODS: We included 62 eyes of 39 patients with congenital cataracts who \nunderwent cataract surgery at Hiroshima University between February 2006 and \nJuly 2022. Pre- and postoperative CCT were measured using a noncontact specular \nmicroscope or ultrasound pachymeter. Cataracts were categorized into five \nmorphologies: anterior, posterior, nuclear, total, and others (aculeiform, \ncalcific, cortical, lamellar, pulverulent, and membranous). Statistical analyses \nwere conducted using JMP software, with significance set at P\u2009<\u20090.05.\nRESULTS: No significant differences in CCT were observed between bilateral and \nunilateral cataracts or between operated and fellow eyes with unilateral \ncataracts. However, when cataracts were categorized according to morphology into \nfive categories, namely, anterior cataract, posterior cataract, nuclear \ncataract, total cataract, and others, the others group exhibited significantly \nthicker CCT than did the control group (566.6\u2009\u00b1\u200976.2\u00a0\u00b5m vs. 525.9\u2009\u00b1\u200931.2\u00a0\u00b5m, \nP\u2009=\u20090.032). Preoperative CCT decreased inversely with age. Postoperative CCT \nincreased significantly compared with preoperative measurements (544.0\u2009\u00b1\u200935.9\u00a0\u00b5m \nvs. 534.5\u2009\u00b1\u200928.4\u00a0\u00b5m, P\u2009=\u20090.021).\nCONCLUSION: This study highlights that congenital cataract of specific \nmorphologies, particularly those classified in the others group, affect CCT. \nPreoperative CCT decreased with age.

Fifteen \nfocused on cataract, 17 on diabetic retinopathy, and seven on general \nophthalmology. This article focuses on the twenty-four studies of moderate or \nhigh quality. Rural residents were more likely to benefit (16 studies) while \ndirect effectiveness among women were reported in seven studies. Only three \nstudies reported actual benefits for older people. Outreach services and \nteleophthalmology were effective interventions increasing screening attendance \nand referral rates for women and rural residents. Health financing to enhance \ncataract surgery acceptance and actual surgical rates reported effectiveness for \nrural residents but showed only modest improvements. Digital technology improved \noverall appointment uptake and referral adherence for rural residents but not \nsignificantly for women. Teleophthalmology was successful in building local \ncapacity for accurate diagnosis but its impact on referral compliance was not \ndemonstrated. Limited evidence was found for the effectiveness of health \neducation alone to boost screening attendance for either subgroup.\nDISCUSSION: The evidence for effectiveness in reducing inequities is not always \ndirect, uses mixed outcomes, and had heterogenous designs. Yet, the results of \nthe higher quality publications in this review indicate modest improvements \nworth pursuing further.\nSYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: \nhttps://osf.io/yr7tg/files/osfstorage?view_only=968ba9e8c910470ca227dcdb0da3cda8.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Cardona, Alwenya, Rehman, Olalo, Thai, Rangi, Perez and Lee.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fpubh.2025.1578848\nPMCID: PMC12230066\nPMID: 40626165 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n42.

Previous in-vitro \nstudies of recombinant \u03b2A3\u0394G91 showed defective folding, decreased solubility, \nand aberrant oligomerization of \u03b2A3\u0394G91 with other crystallins. Emerging \nevidence demonstrates an association between autophagy and \u03b2A3\u0394G91-induced \ncongenital cataracts. To gain further understanding of the molecular mechanism \nof congenital cataract development in \u03b2A3\u0394G91 mice, we examined the \u03b2A3\u0394G91- vs \nWT- lenses for complete gene profiling, lens epithelial cell (LEC) proliferation \nand migration, and lens epithelial-fiber cell differentiation. We also \ndetermined the changes in crystallin proteomic profiles in water-soluble, \nwater-insoluble-urea-soluble, and water-insoluble-urea-insoluble fractions. Our \nresults show that relative to WT lenses, the \u03b2A3\u0394G91 lenses showed: (A) \ndownregulation of genes associated with LECs proliferation and migration (B) \nabnormal suture line pattern, (C) significant reduction in proliferation and \nmigration of LECs, (D) abnormal F-actin distribution, (E) increased high \nmolecular weight (HMW) peak, and (F) insolubilization and degradation of \ncrystallins and other lens proteins.

A total of 50 eyes of 27 \npatients were included. The absolute error (AE, the absolute value of the \ndifference between the actual Spherical Equivalent after cataract surgery and \nthe Equivalent Spherical predicted by the IOL formulas) and the percentage of \neyes with AE within 0.5D, 0.75D, 1.0D, and 2.0D were calculated by using three \nformulas: the VRF formula, the Kane formula and the Barrett True-K No History \nformula and were compared.\nRESULTS: There was a significant difference in AE values between the three \nformulas (X2\u2009=\u200933.556, p\u2009<\u20090.001), with the VRF formula having the smallest \nmedian AE value (MedAE) of 0.580D, followed by the Kane formula (0.585D), and \nthe Barrett True-K No History formula (0.670D) the largest. Using the VRF \nformula, the percentages of eyes with AE within 0.5D, 0.75D, 1.0D, and 2.0D were \n48%, 66%, 78%, and 94%, respectively, which were equal to or higher than the \nother two formulas.\nCONCLUSION: For this cohort of patients with cataract after RK, the VRF formula \nwas the most accurate, and the Kane formula also demonstrated good accuracy. \nBoth formulas can be tried to be applied to predict IOL power in patients with \ncataract after RK in future clinical practice.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Lens \nparameters were measured using CASIA2 and IOL Master 700. Patients were \nsub-grouped by Emery-Little classification and AL. Statistical and regression \nanalyses were performed.\nRESULTS: Severe nuclear sclerosis (Emery-Little grade IV) exhibited smaller back \ncurvature radii (BCR; P\u2009=\u20090.008), lens diameter (P\u2009=\u20090.005), and greater lens \ndecentration (P\u2009=\u20090.012). Long AL eyes (\u2265\u200925.5\u00a0mm) showed higher lens \ndecentration (P\u2009=\u20090.026) and lower lens tilt (P\u2009<\u20090.001). BCR strongly \ncorrelated with lens diameter (r\u2009=\u20090.904, P\u2009<\u20090.001). Regression identified lens \ndiameter as the primary predictor of BCR (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.758). Compared with the \ndecentration of the lens (R\u00b2 = 0.045), tilt is easier to predict (R\u00b2 = 0.125).\nCONCLUSION: The degree of lens nucleus sclerosis and axial length may affect the \nmorphologic features of the lens. It may be considered that how the lens \nmorphology with excessive nucleus sclerosis or abnormal axial length impact the \nefficacy and safety of cataract surgery.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

We used fluorescence correlation \nspectroscopy (FCS) to recognize intermediate aggregate species and characterized \nthem with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Further, the \nmorphologic characterization of aggregates was done by transmission electron \nmicroscopy (TEM), and their hydrophobic characteristics were analyzed using the \n8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid binding assay.\nRESULTS: A negligible lag phase was observed in the aggregation kinetic \nexperiments of the \u03b3D-crystallin protein. Pentamer, 25-mer, and higher oligomer \nintermediates were formed on the aggregation pathway. Conformation studies by \nFCS and FTIR have shown that oligomers are rich in cross-\u03b2 sheet and random coil \nstructure; however, they constitute more \u03b1-helix and less cross-\u03b2 sheet \nstructure than fibrils. TEM analysis revealed the approximate size of oligomers \n(diameter ~10 nm), protofibrils (~15 nm), and fibrils (~15 to ~35 nm).\nCONCLUSIONS: In this study, we reported the presence of various intermediate \naggregate species formed on the aggregation pathway of \u03b3D-crystallin protein at \nlow pH. This will open new areas of research in understanding the detailed \naggregation mechanism and aggregation hotspot within unfolded \u03b3D-crystallin \nmonomers. The insights gained will also pave the way for future research in the \nrealm of amyloid formation in cataract.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Molecular Vision.\n\nPMCID: PMC12221310\nPMID: 40606473 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n46.

Patients with cataracts scheduled \nfor bilateral phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation at the \nDepartment of Ophthalmology, Chinese PLA General Hospital between January and \nSeptember 2024, who also had hearing loss, were enrolled as the observation \ngroup. The control group comprised older adults with hearing loss but without \ncataracts. Data including age, gender distribution, 5-meter best-corrected \nvisual acuity (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution, logMAR), mean \nhearing threshold, and speech recognition rate (SRR) were recorded and compared \nbetween the two groups. Statistical analyses were performed using the paired \nt-test, chi-square test, and multivariate linear regression analysis. Results: \nThe observation group included 22 patients, and the control group comprised 10 \npatients. A statistically significant difference in age was observed between the \nobservation group [(75.18\u00b16.62) years] and the control group [(60.90\u00b14.65) \nyears] (P<0.05). No statistically significant differences were found in gender \ndistribution (observation group: 14 males, 6 females; control group: 4 males, 6 \nfemales) or mean hearing thresholds [observation group: (38.14\u00b19.82) dB; control \ngroup: (35.70\u00b14.00) dB] between the two groups (both P>0.05). The differences in \nbest-corrected visual acuity and SRR between the two groups were statistically \nsignificant (both P<0.05). Postoperatively, bilateral best-corrected visual \nacuity in the observation group improved significantly compared to preoperative \nvalues (right eye: 0.06\u00b10.11 vs. 0.74\u00b10.55; left eye: 0.05\u00b10.09 vs. 0.59\u00b10.35; \nboth P<0.05). No significant changes in mean binaural hearing thresholds were \ndetected (both P>0.05). However, the postoperative SRR increased significantly \nto 0.82\u00b10.09 compared to the preoperative value of 0.69\u00b10.13 (P<0.05). There \nwere no statistically significant differences in the postoperative \nbest-corrected visual acuity and SRR between the two groups (both P>0.05). \nRegression analysis using baseline data, adjusted for gender and mean hearing \nthreshold, revealed a significant inverse association between visual acuity and \nSRR (\u03b2=-0.13, 95%CI:-0.22 to -0.04, P<0.05). Conclusions: Visual acuity is \ncorrelated with the speech recognition ability in older adults. Post-cataract \nsurgery visual improvement leads to enhanced speech discrimination performance \nin elderly individuals with concurrent hearing loss, thereby expanding the \ntherapeutic implications of cataract surgery.\n\nPublisher: \u76ee\u7684\uff1a \u63a2\u8ba8\u767d\u5185\u969c\u6458\u9664\u624b\u672f\u540e\u89c6\u529b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e0e\u4f34\u6709\u542c\u529b\u635f\u5931\u7684\u767d\u5185\u969c\u8001\u5e74\u60a3\u8005\u8a00\u8bed\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u8054\u5173\u7cfb\u3002 \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a \n\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u961f\u5217\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u9009\u53d62024\u5e741\u81f39\u6708\u5728\u89e3\u653e\u519b\u603b\u533b\u9662\u773c\u79d1\u533b\u5b66\u90e8\u56e0\u767d\u5185\u969c\u62df\u884c\u53cc\u773c\u8d85\u58f0\u4e73\u5316\u767d\u5185\u969c\u5438\u9664\u4eba\u5de5\u6676\u72b6\u4f53\u690d\u5165\u672f\u4e14\u4f34\u6709\u542c\u529b\u635f\u5931\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u4e3a\u89c2\u5bdf\u7ec4\uff0c\u65e0\u767d\u5185\u969c\u7684\u542c\u529b\u635f\u5931\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u4e3a\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\uff0c\u8bb0\u5f55\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u7ec4\u7684\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u6027\u522b\u5206\u5e03\u30015 \nm\u6700\u4f73\u77eb\u6b63\u89c6\u529b\uff08\u6700\u5c0f\u5206\u8fa8\u89d2\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\uff09\u3001\u5e73\u5747\u542c\u9608\u548c\u8a00\u8bed\u8bc6\u522b\u7387\uff08SRR\uff09\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u914d\u5bf9t\u68c0\u9a8c\u3001\u5361\u65b9\u68c0\u9a8c\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u56e0\u7d20\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002 \u7ed3\u679c\uff1a \n\u89c2\u5bdf\u7ec4\u60a3\u800522\u4f8b\uff0c\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u60a3\u800510\u4f8b\u3002\u89c2\u5bdf\u7ec4\u5e74\u9f84\uff3b\uff0875.18\u00b16.62\uff09\u5c81\uff3d\u4e0e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\uff3b\uff0860.90\u00b14.65\uff09\u5c81\uff3d\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5dee\u5f02\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08P<0.05\uff09\uff1b\u89c2\u5bdf\u7ec4\u6027\u522b\u5206\u5e03\uff08\u7537\u602714\u4f8b\uff0c\u5973\u60276\u4f8b\uff09\u4e0e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\uff08\u7537\u60274\u4f8b\uff0c\u5973\u60276\u4f8b\uff09\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u7ec4\u5e73\u5747\u542c\u9608\uff3b\uff0838.14\u00b19.82\uff09dB\uff3d\u4e0e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\uff3b\uff0835.70\u00b14.00\uff09dB\uff3d\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5dee\u5f02\u5747\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08\u5747P>0.05\uff09\uff1b\u89c2\u5bdf\u7ec4\u89c6\u529b\u548cSRR\u4e0e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5dee\u5f02\u5747\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08\u5747P<0.05\uff09\u3002\u89c2\u5bdf\u7ec4\u8d85\u58f0\u4e73\u5316\u767d\u5185\u969c\u5438\u9664\u4eba\u5de5\u6676\u72b6\u4f53\u690d\u5165\u672f\u540e\u53cc\u773c\u89c6\u529b\uff08\u53f3\u773c\u4e3a0.06\u00b10.11\uff0c\u5de6\u773c\u4e3a0.05\u00b10.09\uff09\u4e0e\u672f\u524d\uff08\u53f3\u773c\u4e3a0.74\u00b10.55\uff0c\u5de6\u773c\u4e3a0.59\u00b10.35\uff09\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5dee\u5f02\u5747\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08\u5747P<0.05\uff09\uff1b\u624b\u672f\u524d\u540e\u53cc\u8033\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u542c\u9608\u5dee\u5f02\u5747\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08\u5747P>0.05\uff09\uff1b\u672f\u540eSRR\uff080.82\u00b10.09\uff09\u9ad8\u4e8e\u672f\u524d\uff080.69\u00b10.13\uff09\uff0c\u5dee\u5f02\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08P<0.05\uff09\u3002\u89c2\u5bdf\u7ec4\u672f\u540e\u89c6\u529b\u548cSRR\u4e0e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5dee\u5f02\u5747\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08\u5747P>0.05\uff09\u3002\u5728\u8c03\u6574\u6027\u522b\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u542c\u9608\u540e\uff0c\u89c6\u529b\u4e0eSRR\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5173\u8054\uff08\u03b2=-0.13\uff0c95%\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\uff1a-0.22~-0.04\uff0cP<0.05\uff09\u3002 \n\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a \u767d\u5185\u969c\u6458\u9664\u624b\u672f\u540e\u89c6\u529b\u5f97\u5230\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u767d\u5185\u969c\u4f34\u6709\u542c\u529b\u635f\u5931\u8001\u5e74\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u8a00\u8bed\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u8054\u3002.\n\nDOI: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112142-20250106-00010\nPMID: 40605307 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n47.

We therefore aimed to identify \nferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) related to cataracts and assess their causal \nassociation.\nMETHODS: We downloaded two gene expression profile datasets of patients with \ncataracts and gathered the FRGs from the MSigDB and GeneCards databases. This \nallowed us to find the ferroptosis-related differentially expressed genes \n(FRDEGs). The potential functions of these FRDEGs were explored using Kyoto \nEncyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), gene ontology (GO), and gene set \nenrichment analysis (GSEA). A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was \nestablished, and hub genes were screened. Additionally, potential diagnostic \nmarkers were identified by RT-PCR validation. Finally, a Mendelian randomization \n(MR) study was performed to ascertain the causal impact of FRDEGs on cataracts.\nRESULTS: Nineteen FRDEGs were identified by overlapping DEGs with FRGs. GO, KEGG \nand GSEA showed that the FRDEGs were associated with oxidative stress, IL17 \nsignaling pathway, and glutathione metabolism. Nine hub genes were identified \nusing the PPI network and five algorithms in Cytoscape. The RT-PCR results \nvalidated TIGAR, IL6, ATF3, and TNFAIP3 as potential biomarkers.\nCONCLUSION: TIGAR and IL6 were identified to be causally associated with \ncataracts. Inverse variance weighting revealed that TIGAR decreased the risk of \ncataracts, whereas IL6 increased the risk of cataract. Our research identified \nferroptosis-related hub genes in cataracts, providing valuable insights for \npre-symptomatic diagnosis and contributing to our understanding of the molecular \nmechanisms of cataract risk genes.\n\n\u00a9 2025.
