ICIs can cause rheumatic-immune related adverse events \n(Rh-irAEs) such as inflammatory arthritis and myositis. Few case reports detail \nRh-irAEs and their management in the pediatric population. Our objective was to \nassess the familiarity of pediatric rheumatologists (PRs) worldwide with \nRh-irAEs, gauge confidence in managing these conditions, and identify knowledge \ngaps to guide future educational efforts.\nMETHODS: We circulated an online survey to 2084 PRs via the \"Dr. Peter Dent \nPediatric Rheumatology Bulletin Board.\" Responses were collected from June 2024 \nto September 2024. We collected data on practitioner demographics, knowledge of \nICIs and Rh-irAEs, confidence in managing Rh-irAEs, and preferred educational \nresources.\nRESULTS: Sixty-nine participants responded, of which 55 (80%) were PRs from \nacademic centers. Despite global distribution, 56 (81%) responses came from \nNorth America. Thirty-four (49%) respondents were not aware of ICIs and their \nrelated mechanisms, indications, and side effects, and 40 (58%) were not \nfamiliar with irAEs. Fifty-five (80%) had never managed a patient with Rh-irAEs. \nAmong those who had (14/69, 21%), the median number of cases managed was 2.0 \n(IQR 0.0). Thirty-nine respondents were \"not confident at all\" managing \nRh-irAEs, 34 were \"not confident at all\" managing pre-existing autoimmune \ndiseases (PAD) in ICI users, and 46 were \"not confident at all\" advising \noncology colleagues on initiating or discontinuing ICIs in the context of \nRh-irAEs or pre-existing autoimmune diseases (PAD). No respondents felt \n\"completely confident\" managing these conditions. Participants identified \nknowledge gaps in long-term management, acute management, and recognition and \ndiagnosis. Forty-three indicated the need for pediatric-specific clinical \nguidelines. Of the 14 respondents with clinical experience treating Rh-irAEs, \ntreatment varied, with 4 using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 3 using \nprednisone, and 4 combining prednisone with methotrexate. Long-term management \nalso varied, with 5 using methotrexate, and 3 using tumor necrosis factor \ninhibitors.\nCONCLUSIONS: Significant knowledge gaps and a lack of confidence exist among PRs \nmanaging ICI-related Rh-irAEs. As ICI use increases in pediatric oncology, PRs' \nexposure to Rh-irAEs will follow. Targeted educational programs and clinical \nguidelines may be valuable to address these gaps.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

This study \naimed to assess rheumatology patients' awareness, willingness to use, \nsuitability, and actual adoption of DiGAs. Between February 17 and April 8, \n2025, adult patients attending seven German rheumatology outpatient clinics \ncompleted an electronic survey. A total of 246 patients participated (mean age \n50.4 years; 71.1% female), with most treated at university hospitals (59.8%). \nThe predominant diagnoses were rheumatoid arthritis (41.1%), psoriatic arthritis \n(18.3%), and axial spondyloarthritis (10.2%). While only 19.5% reported prior \nuse of medical apps, 39.8% were aware of DiGAs, and 12.6% had used one. Notably, \n84.6% reported at least one comorbidity matching an approved DiGA indication, \nmost commonly back pain (54.8%), chronic pain (52.0%), and sleep disorders \n(35.8%). A majority expressed willingness to regularly use a DiGA (72.4%) and \nwere open to recommendations from their rheumatologists or health insurers \n(72.8%). Additionally, 76.0% showed interest in a rheumatology-specific DiGA. \nDespite high interest and relevant comorbidities among patients, current DiGA \nuse was limited. These findings underscore the need for targeted implementation \nstrategies to increase uptake and realize the full potential of digital health \napplications in rheumatology care. The results also emphasize the need for \nrheumatologists to actively educate and guide their patients regarding the \navailability and potential benefits of DiGAs.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

This study aims to assess the collection and use of \noccupation-related data in rheumatology clinical narratives, describe factors \ninfluencing its collection, and analyze its association with patient diagnoses. \nWe employed a pre-trained Spanish language model fine-tuned with biomedical \ntexts to identify occupation mentions in the EHR of 35,586 rheumatic patients. \nThe model's performance was evaluated using a gold-standard dataset with \nprecision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Occupation mentions were normalized \nusing the European Skills, Competences, Qualifications, and Occupations (ESCO) \nclassification. Logistic regression analyses identified sociodemographic and \nclinical predictors of occupation collection and examined associations between \noccupations and diagnoses. The model achieved an F1-score of 0.73, identifying \nvalid occupation mentions in 3527 patients (10%). Normalization yielded 402 ESCO \ncodes. Mechanical pathologies such as back pain and muscle disorders were \nassociated with a higher probability of occupation collection, while professions \nlike cleaners and helpers were linked to these conditions. Customer service \nclerks and hairdressers were associated with autoimmune diseases. This study \ndemonstrates the feasibility of automated occupation recognition in EHRs, \nhighlighting the relevance of occupational data as a social determinant of \nhealth in rheumatology. Integrating such data could inform targeted prevention \nand treatment strategies for rheumatic diseases.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Given the \nincreasing clinical interest in AI and its potential to augment care delivery, \nthis article aims to bridge the gap between technical innovation and real-world \nrheumatology practice.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Several AI models have demonstrated high accuracy in early RA \ndetection using imaging modalities such as thermal imaging and nuclear scans. \nPredictive models for treatment response have leveraged routinely collected \nelectronic health record (EHR) data, moving closer to practical application in \nclinical workflows. Patient-facing tools like mobile symptom checkers and large \nlanguage models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT show promise in enhancing education and \nengagement, although accuracy and safety remain variable. AI has also shown \nutility in identifying novel biomarkers and accelerating drug discovery. Despite \nthese advances, as of early 2025, no AI-based tools have received FDA approval \nfor use in rheumatology, in contrast to other specialties. Artificial \nintelligence holds tremendous promise to enhance clinical care in RA-from early \ndiagnosis to personalized therapy. However, clinical adoption remains limited \ndue to regulatory, technical, and implementation challenges. A streamlined \nregulatory framework and closer collaboration between clinicians, researchers, \nand industry partners are urgently needed. With thoughtful integration, AI can \nserve as a valuable adjunct in addressing clinical complexity and workforce \nshortages in rheumatology.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases \n(SARDs) and hematological malignancies are particularly susceptible to \ndeveloping SHG due to underlying diseases and the use of immunosuppressive \nmedications, such as B-cell-targeted agents. Consequently, SHG significantly \ncontributes to increased risks of severe infections and mortality in SARDs \npatients. Considering the lack of a unified strategy for managing SHG, the \nTaiwan College of Rheumatology (TCR) aimed to formulate consensus \nrecommendations for the screening, diagnosis, and management of SHG. These \nrecommendations were developed based on emerging evidence during a face-to-face \nmeeting of the TCR committee (nine immunologists and rheumatologists), and \nutilizing the modified Delphi process. This meeting involved a comprehensive \nreview of the current evidence, using the Grading of Recommendations, \nAssessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Thirteen consensus \nrecommendations were developed to emphasize the importance of early detection \nand optimal treatment of SHG. Furthermore, effective prevention of infections \nthrough risk assessment alongside timely and regular monitoring of IgG levels \nwas highlighted. The recommendations also included anti-infective therapies and \nintravenous Ig replacement, offering valuable guidance to rheumatologists in \nmanaging SHG. This consensus will be regularly updated as newer evidence \nemerges.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

A framework analysis was used to characterise parents' \nexperiences and perspectives.\nRESULTS: Eighteen parents participated. Their children had a median age of 13 \nyears (SD= 3.16 years, Range= 6-16 years, 55\u202f% male), with diagnoses of chronic \nprimary pain (e.g. Ehlers Danlos syndrome/Hypermobility) and chronic secondary \npain (e.g. Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis). Data were organised into four themes: \n1) Parents' active role in pain communication, 2) Building blocks of effective \npain communication, 3) Stark realities of pain communication and 4) Purpose for \nprioritising pain communication. Parents discussed their role in advocating for \ntheir child and encouraging their child to communicate about their pain. Parents \nreported experiences of unsatisfactory pain management advice being provided and \nfrequent experiences of their child's pain being dismissed by healthcare \nprofessionals.\nCONCLUSION: Findings emphasise several advantages of involving parents in \ncommunication about their child's pain, as well as a range of challenges in pain \ncommunication with healthcare professionals from parent perspectives.\nPRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: These findings inform recommendations to facilitate more \neffective pain communication approaches which include parents in the future.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 The Authors.

The goal of this \nstudy was to evaluate vitamin D levels and associated factors in a clinical \ncohort of German patients presenting to a rheumatology clinic. Methods: We \nconducted a retrospective observational study of electronic health record data \nfrom patients presenting to a rheumatology clinic in southern Germany. Data \nincluded demographic characteristics and vitamin D levels as measured by the \nElecsys\u00ae Vitamin D total III assay (Roche). Associations between vitamin D \nlevels and patient characteristics were evaluated by Pearson correlation \nanalyses, t-tests, and multiple regression analyses. We also explored seasonal \nchanges. Results: A total of 4979 patients were included; 3230 (64.9%) were \nfemale and the mean (standard deviation [SD]) age was 53.6 (15.2) years. The \nmean (SD) vitamin D level was 27.4 (14.0) ng/mL (range, 3-240 ng/mL). Overall, \n1540 (30.9%) had vitamin D levels in the deficient range (<20 ng/mL), 1774 \n(35.6%) had sufficient vitamin D (20 to 30 ng/mL), 1597 (32.1%) had optimal \nvitamin D levels (>30 to 70 ng/mL), and 68 (1.4%) had levels >70 ng/mL. Lower \nvitamin D levels were significantly associated with younger age, male sex, and \nhigher body mass index. Mean levels were significantly lower during winter \nmonths and the percentages of patients with vitamin D deficiency were higher. \nConclusions: Our data indicate that low levels of vitamin D are common in \nclinical cohorts, particularly in men, younger adults, overweight individuals, \nand during winter months. Patient education and/or supplementation may help to \naddress this issue and potentially improve patient health.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/nu17111893\nPMCID: PMC12158044\nPMID: 40507162 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Authors M.S.K., A.N. and M.F. were employed by \nthe company MVZ MED BAYERN OST.

Following the Grading of \nRecommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology, a team of \nmethodologists conducted a systematic literature review, extracted and \nsummarised intervention effect estimates, and assessed the quality of evidence. \nThe panel of paediatric rheumatologists voted on each PICO question and \nformulated recommendations, requiring a consensus of at least 70% amongst the \nvoting members. Eight recommendations and one expert opinion statement were \ndeveloped. For newly diagnosed poly-JIA or those with minimal disease activity, \nthe use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as adjuvant therapy, along with \na non-biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (nbDMARD) is recommended. \nFor children and young people achieving an inactive disease state, continuation \nof nbDMARD treatment for at least 12 months post-remission is advised. In cases \nof methotrexate intolerance, contraindications, limited availability, or \nnon-response, leflunomide could be used as an alternative. For children and \nyoung people with high disease activity or poor prognostic factors, the addition \nof a biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARD) is recommended. \nTriple therapy with methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine can be \nconsidered when bDMARDs are not available. Low-dose, short-term corticosteroid \nuse is also recommended. The first PANLAR poly-JIA treatment guidelines offer \nevidence-based recommendations to support health-care providers in the \nmanagement of poly-JIA in Latin America.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

We \naimed to obtain outcome measurements of disease activity, functional capacity, \ndisease damage, and therapeutic response, at one-year follow-up study on a \nreal-life basis.\nMETHODS: An observational JIA cohort from two referral centers for pediatric \nrheumatology in Brazil Pediatric Rheumatology Centers was carried out over a \nperiod of one year. Clinimetric validated outcome measurements were applied over \nfour visits. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to evaluate \nbaseline variables associated with the following outcomes after one year of \nfollow-up: disease activity, Minimal Disease Activity (MDA), disease flare, \nremission on medication and remission off medication.\nRESULTS: A total of 127 patients were included in the study. Eighty-three \n(65.4%) were females, and median time to diagnosis was 6.0 months. JADAS71 and \nCHAQ improved during follow-up (mean Vbaseline 7.05\u2009\u00b1\u20099.3 vs. V52 3.52\u2009\u00b1\u20098.4; \n0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5 vs. 0.14\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4, p\u2009<\u20090.001, respectively) as well as JIA-ACR 30, 50, 70 \nand 90 (Vbaseline 79.8% vs. V52 88.8%; 71.4% vs. 84.1%; 59.7% vs. 77.6%; 49.6% \nvs. 69.2%, p\u2009<\u20090.05, respectively). Inactive disease was present in 33% of \npatients at baseline and in 67.9% at V52 (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Remission on medication, \nremission off medication and MDA were present in 46%, 11%, and 80.6% of patients \nat V52, respectively. Extra-articular and articular damage were not common at \nbaseline (0.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7 and 1.1\u2009\u00b1\u20093.4 respectively) and did not decrease \nsignificantly during the period of the study. The presence of active joints \n46/101 (45.5%) at baseline reduced the chance of the patient achieving remission \noff medication at the last visit by 84% (OR\u2009=\u20090.16; CI 95% from 0.03 to 0.91, \np\u2009=\u20090.039).\nCONCLUSION: This study showed improvement in clinimetric outcome measurements \nand therapeutic responses in an inception cohort of JIA patients. The presence \nof active joints at baseline is related to not achieving remission at last \nvisit. Long-term prospective and multicenter studies are needed to better assess \nthe outcome of JIA and the differences among JIA subtypes.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

We included Bachelors of Physical Education \nand Physical Therapists because they are professionals who use exercise as a \ntherapeutic intervention for musculoskeletal rehabilitation. We assessed their \nknowledge using structured questions based on the EULAR. We used the Chi-squared \ntest (\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a05\u00a0%) to compare the number of correct and incorrect answers and \ncalculated the effect size (w value) by dividing the chi-squared value by the \nnumber of scores and taking the square root (small: w\u00a0=\u00a00.10, medium: w\u00a0=\u00a00.30, \nand large: w\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.50).\nRESULTS: The sample of this study consists of 116 health professionals with a \nmean age of 34.43 (\u00b18.71) years. The majority are women and Physical Therapists. \nRegarding the health professionals' knowledge about the use of exercise in \npatients with musculoskeletal disorders, we observed a significant number of \nincorrect answers (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) to the EULAR questions. Clinically, the large \neffect size (w\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.5) for the number of errors indicated a worrying situation \nfor the musculoskeletal rehabilitation scenario.\nCONCLUSION: Bachelors of physical education, as well as physical therapists, are \nnot scientifically prepared to rehabilitate people with rheumatic and \nmusculoskeletal diseases through physical exercise.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

To \nestablish the state of the art of the applications of CAR therapies in \nrheumatology, PubMed, EMBASE, Lilacs, as well as clinical trial registries were \nsearched. Any type of original article that reported the use of these therapies \nin patients with SARD was included. Forty-eight studies were included from \ndatabases. Ninety-five ongoing trials were included from clinical trials \nregistries. The most used type of CAR was a CAR-T against CD19, showing good \npreliminary results. Other targets used were BCMA, PD-1, a modified HLA and \ncitrullinated peptides among others. The use of other cell types such as natural \nkiller and regulatory T cells was also found. CAR-based therapies in \nrheumatology are in an early stage of development but with promising results. \nThere has been a notable growth in human patients treated with this intervention \nin the last 2\u00a0years.

The pediatric rheumatology workforce \nshortage and lack of focused American Board of Pediatrics rheumatology content \nspecifications lead to challenges in the adequate education of trainees. The \npurpose of this study was to define essential knowledge areas in rheumatology \nfor pediatric residents.\nMETHODS: A literature search was performed to identify resources pertinent to \nresident education in pediatric rheumatology. Results were used to inform items \non a survey asking, \"How important is it for graduating pediatric residents to \ndemonstrate competency in each of these rheumatology-related activities?\" \nStakeholders in rheumatology-related pediatric resident education were invited \nto participate in a modified Delphi process. Subsequent surveys were created \niteratively based on their responses.\nRESULTS: Twenty-one panelists from diverse geographic regions and specialties \ncompleted 2 rounds of surveys with a 100% completion rate. Analysis yielded 107 \nitems: those rated by >70% of respondents as \"Very Important\" were categorized \nas Essential (n\u2009=\u200954, 47.7%), and those rated by >70% of respondents as either \n\"Very Important\" or \"Somewhat Important\" were categorized as Recommended \n(n\u2009=\u200955, 52.3%).\nCONCLUSIONS: Broad content specifications are insufficient to prepare graduating \npediatric residents to address cRDs in practice. Given the pediatric \nrheumatology workforce shortage, access to an expanded, standardized list of \ncritical rheumatology-related competencies is essential to better prepare \ngraduating pediatric residents to evaluate patients with cRDs. These \ncompetencies should drive curriculum design to enhance pediatric resident \neducation.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nDOI: 10.1542/peds.2024-069821\nPMID: 40473248 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n13.

The outcomes of interest were visual analog scale (VAS), knee function \nscores, radiological results, and complication rates. Case-control studies were \nassessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale, and randomized controlled trials were \nindependently evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration's assessment tool. \nHeterogeneity was tested using I\u00b2, and a fixed or random-effects model was \nselected for meta-analysis based on the heterogeneity results. Of the 21 studies \nincluded, 17 were case-control studies and 4 were RCTs.\nRESULTS: A total of 21 studies, including 1006 knees, were included in the \nmeta-analysis. PFO can effectively alleviate the most troubling pain for \npatients (VAS: mean difference MD = -4.25 [-5.51; -3.00]) and significantly \nimprove postoperative knee function (Hedges' g\u2009=\u20092.41 [1.35-3.47]). Moreover, \ndue to the minimal surgical trauma, the incidence of postoperative complications \nis low, with sensory abnormalities of the common peroneal nerve being the most \ncommon adverse event (5.93%; 95% CI: 2.15-11.25%), followed by common peroneal \nnerve palsy (2.25%; 95% CI: 0.14-6.14%), fracture (0.56%; 95% CI: 0-1.74%), and \nonly two cases of infection were reported in all included studies, both of which \nrecovered within half a year. In addition, PFO can effectively improve the \nradiological outcomes, with an increase in HKA (MD\u2009=\u20091.73 [0.33; 3.13]), a \ndecrease in FTA (MD = -3.83 [-4.05; -3.62]), an increase in knee joint space \n(MD\u2009=\u20092.66\u00a0mm[2.38; 2.94]), and an increase in the ratio of medial to lateral \nknee joint space (MD\u2009=\u20090.16 [0.15; 0.18]).\nCONCLUSION: In the field of MKOA treatment, PFO has shown a promising prospect. \nThe clinical function scores and radiological assessments improved after PFO in \nthis meta-analysis, indicating that this surgical method can significantly \nimprove patients' symptoms, correct the varus deformity of the lower limb \nalignment, and is safe. However, it must be pointed out that the quality of \nevidence supporting this conclusion is still low, and radiological studies are \nrelatively few. Therefore, future studies need to be conducted in more diverse \npatient populations, incorporating more radiological indicators and providing \nhigher-quality clinical evidence.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

While probiotics have shown anti-inflammatory \npotential in preclinical studies, their therapeutic role in OA has not been well \nestablished in human research. This exploratory randomized controlled trial \n(RCT) aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Latilactobacillus sakei \nLB-P12 in improving knee OA symptoms. In this randomized, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled trial, 100 participants aged 40-75\u00a0years with chronic knee \npain were assigned to receive either LB-P12 (350\u00a0mg/day, 10 billion CFU) or \nplacebo for 12\u00a0weeks. The primary outcome was the change in Western Ontario and \nMcMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scores. Secondary outcomes \nincluded visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain, inflammatory markers (CRP, \nESR, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1), cartilage degradation biomarkers (COMP), joint space \nwidth, and health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L). Safety was evaluated using \nlaboratory tests and vital signs. After 12\u00a0weeks, the LB-P12 group showed \nsignificantly greater improvements in WOMAC total scores and VAS pain scores \ncompared to the placebo group. All three WOMAC subdomains-pain, stiffness, and \nphysical function-showed consistent reductions. Inflammatory cytokines, \nparticularly IL-1\u03b2, were significantly reduced in the LB-P12 group. Quality of \nlife also improved significantly. No adverse events or clinically meaningful \nabnormalities in laboratory values were observed. This exploratory RCT suggests \nthat daily supplementation with LB-P12 is safe and may offer potential benefits \nin reducing knee pain and improving physical function and quality of life in \nindividuals with knee OA. Further large-scale and long-term RCTs are needed to \nconfirm these findings and elucidate the underlying mechanisms.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

The \ntotal proportion of children with carditis was 61%. Australian compared with New \nZealand participants more commonly had ARF recurrence (22% vs 0%), underlying \nRHD (48% vs 0%), possible/probable ARF (23% vs 9%) and were underweight (64% vs \n16%). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) provided an incremental diagnostic \nyield of 21% compared with C reactive protein. No instances of RHD were \ndiagnosed among participants in New Zealand. Positive throat Group A \nStreptococcus culture was more common in New Zealand than in Australian \nparticipants (69% vs 3%). Children often required prolonged hospitalisation, \nwith median hospital length-of-stay being 7\u2009days (range 2-66). Significant \npredictors for length of stay in a multivariable regression model were valve \ndisease (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.56, 95%\u2009CI 1.23 to 1.98, p<0.001), requirement for \ncorticosteroids (aOR 1.99, 95%\u2009CI 1.22 to 3.26, p=0.007) and higher ESR (aOR \n1.4, 95%\u2009CI 1.17 to 1.67, p<0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: This study provides new knowledge on ARF characteristics and \nmanagement and highlights international variation in diagnostic and management \npractice. Differing approaches need to be aligned. Meanwhile, locally specific \ninformation can help guide patient expectations after ARF diagnosis.\n\n\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

Locus coeruleus (LC) functions in pain pathways. \nBrain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) participates in the modulation of \nnociception and pain. A mouse model of RA immunized with collagen-induced \narthritis (CIA) was used for investigating the mechanisms of pain relief by \nadministration of the tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) receptor antagonist \nANA-12. We measured the pain behaviors and locomotor activity and found \nincreased pain sensitivity and locomotor deficit in RA mice; ANA-12 treatment \nreduced pain behaviors and promoted locomotor function recovery. The glial \nactivation and increased activities of BDNF/TrkB and MAPK signal pathways were \nfound in LC of RA mice. The components of NLRP3 inflammasome were all increased \nand consequently enhanced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokine \ninterleukin (IL)-1\u03b2. Upon ANA-12 treatment, glial cell activation was reduced, \nBDNF/TrkB and MAPK pathways were suppressed, and the expression levels of the \nabove-mentioned proteins were reduced. Finally, U251 cells were conducted to \nfurther confirm the regulatory mechanisms of ANA-12 on inflammation. The results \nshowed the colocalization of BDNF/NLRP3/IL-1\u03b2 and GFAP. ANA-12 treatment \ndecreased the protein levels of BDNF, TrkB, MAPK, NLRP3, and caspase-1 in \nIL-1\u03b2-induced cells. Besides, ANA-12 treatment decreased NLRC4 and AIM2 \ninflammasomes both in RA mice and IL-1\u03b2-induced cells. These results suggested \nthat ANA-12 alleviates hyperalgesia in RA mice by inhibiting BDNF/TrkB signaling \nin LC, thereby reducing glial cell activation and inflammatory cytokine release.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

However, few studies have examined the association between disease \nactivity and seasonal differences, and consequently, evidence of a seasonality \nin disease activity in axSpA is limited. We therefore aimed to study the \nvariation in measures of disease activity, perceived well-being, and functional \nability, including both patient-reported and objective measures throughout the \nyear, and their relationship with seasons.\nMETHODS: Objective and patient-reported disease parameters from 44 987 \nassessments on 5197 individuals were retrieved from the Swedish Rheumatology \nQuality register. The variation in different measures of disease activity over \nthe year was examined using generalized additive models with cyclic cubic \nsplines.\nRESULTS: Patient reported and objective measures of disease were found to vary \ncongruently over the year, with a trend of decreased disease parameters in the \nspring. Mean CRP values showed a statistically significant variation throughout \nthe year, with highest in July (7.35\u00a0mg/L) and lowest in March (6.88\u00a0mg/L). \nSignificant seasonal variation was also seen in BASDAI (range of mean values \n3.67-3.72), BASFI (2.79-2.87) and BASMI (3.26-3.31), with highest values in late \nsummer, beginning of fall, or in the fall, respectively. In subgroup analysis, \nsignificant variation was only seen in subjects with a disease duration of more \nthan 10 years.\nCONCLUSION: Although a statistically significant seasonal variation in disease \nparameters was found, the absolute variation was close to none and may therefore \nbe clinically irrelevant.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Cell viability, TRAP-positive multinucleated cells and F-actin ring \nformation in the treated cells were assessed with CCK-8 assay, TRAP staining and \nPhalloidin staining, respectively. Autophagy and autophagosomes in the cells \nwere observed with MDC staining and transmission electron microscopy. ELISA was \nused to measure IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 levels in the culture supernatant, and the \nexpressions of HIF-1\u03b1, BNIP3, Bcl-2, Beclin1, LC3-I, LC3-II, P62 and TRAP mRNAs \nand proteins were analyzed using RT-qPCR and Western blotting.\nRESULTS: In hypoxia- and RANKL-induced RAW264.7 cells treated with normal rat \nserum, significant increments of TRAP-positive cells and F-actin ring formation \nwere observed with an enhanced autophagic fluorescence intensity and increased \nautophagosomes. Treatment of the induced cells with rat sera medicated with MTX \nand low- and high-dose QGKSF obviously reduced the TRAP-positive cells, F-actin \nrings and autophagosomes as well as the autophagic fluorescence intensity. RANKL \ntreatment significantly increased IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 levels in RAW264.7 cells, which \nwere obviously decreased by treatment with MTX- and QGKSF-medicated sera. RANKL \nalso significantly increased the mRNA and protein expression levels of HIF-1\u03b1, \nBNIP3, Bcl-2, Beclin1, LC3 and TRAP and lowered P62 expressions, and these \nchanges were effectively reversed by treatment with MTX- and QGKSF-medicated \nsera.\nCONCLUSIONS: QGKSF attenuates RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation in \nhypoxic RAW264.7 cells by inhibiting the HIF-1\u03b1/BNIP3 autophagy signaling \npathway, suggesting its potential for treatment of bone destruction in \nrheumatoid arthritis.\n\nPublisher: \u76ee\u7684: \u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u9aa8\u5eb7\u758f\u65b9\uff08QGKSF\uff09\u5bf9HIF-1\u03b1/BNIP3\u81ea\u566c\u4fe1\u53f7\u901a\u8def\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u6539\u5584\u7c7b\u98ce\u6e7f\u5173\u8282\u708e\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5: \n\u5236\u5907\u542b\u836f\u8840\u6e05\uff0cRAW264.7\u7ec6\u80de\u4f53\u5916\u57f9\u517b\uff0c\u4f4e\u6c27+RANKL\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7834\u9aa8\u7ec6\u80de\u3002\u5206\u522b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u3001\u7532\u6c28\u8776\u5464\u7ec4\uff08MTX\uff09\u3001QGKSF\u4f4e\u5242\u91cf\u7ec4\uff08QGKSF-L\uff09\u3001QGKSF\u9ad8\u5242\u91cf\u7ec4\uff08QGKSF-H\uff09\u3002CCK-8\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ec6\u80de\u6d3b\u529b\uff1bTRAP\u67d3\u8272\u89c2\u5bdf\u5404\u7ec4TRAP\u9633\u6027\u591a\u6838\u7ec6\u80de\u7684\u6570\u91cf\uff1b\u9b3c\u7b14\u73af\u80bd\u67d3\u8272\u68c0\u6d4bF-\u808c\u52a8\u86cb\u767d\u73af\u5f62\u6210\u60c5\u51b5\uff1bMDC\u67d3\u8272\u89c2\u5bdf\u81ea\u566c\u6ce1\uff1b\u900f\u5c04\u7535\u955c\u89c2\u5bdf\u81ea\u566c\u5c0f\u4f53\uff1bELISA\u68c0\u6d4b\u708e\u75c7\u7ec6\u80de\u56e0\u5b50\uff08IL-6\u3001TNF-\u03b1\uff09\u6c34\u5e73\uff1bWestern \nblotting\u68c0\u6d4bHIF-1\u03b1\u3001BNIP3\u3001Bcl-2\u3001Beclin1\u3001LC3-\u2160\u3001LC3-\u2161\u3001P62\u3001TRAP\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u6c34\u5e73\uff1bRT-qPCR\u68c0\u6d4bHIF-1\u03b1\u3001BNIP3\u3001Bcl-2\u3001Beclin1\u3001LC3\u3001P62\u3001TRAP\u7684mRNA\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u7ed3\u679c: \n\u4e0e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u53ef\u89c1\u5927\u91cfTRAP\u9633\u6027\u7ec6\u80de\uff0cF-\u808c\u52a8\u86cb\u767d\u73af\u5f62\u6210\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u81ea\u566c\u8367\u5149\u5f3a\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u81ea\u566c\u5c0f\u4f53\u589e\u591a\uff08P<0.001\uff09\uff1b\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0cMTX\u7ec4\u3001QGKSF-L\u7ec4\u548cQGKSF-H\u7ec4\u7684TRAP\u9633\u6027\u7ec6\u80de\u6570\u91cf\u548cF-\u808c\u52a8\u86cb\u767d\u73af\u5f62\u6210\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u81ea\u566c\u8367\u5149\u5f3a\u5ea6\u51cf\u5f31\uff0c\u81ea\u566c\u5c0f\u4f53\u51cf\u5c11\uff08P<0.01\uff09\u3002\u4e0e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4IL-6\u3001TNF-\u03b1\u6c34\u5e73\u5347\u9ad8\uff08P<0.001\uff09\uff1b\u7ecf\u8fc7MTX\u548cQGKSF\u6cbb\u7597\u540eIL-6\u3001TNF-\u03b1\u6c34\u5e73\u6709\u6240\u964d\u4f4e\uff08P<0.001\uff09\u3002\u4e0e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4HIF-1\u03b1\u3001BNIP3\u3001Bcl-2\u3001Beclin1\u3001LC3\u3001TRAP\u86cb\u767d\u53camRNA\u6c34\u5e73\u5347\u9ad8\uff0cP62\u86cb\u767d\u53camRNA\u6c34\u5e73\u964d\u4f4e\uff08P<0.01\uff09\uff1b\u7ecfMTX\u53caQGKSF\u6cbb\u7597\u540e\uff0cHIF-1\u03b1\u3001BNIP3\u3001Bcl-2\u3001Beclin1\u3001LC3\u3001TRAP\u86cb\u767d\u53camRNA\u6c34\u5e73\u964d\u4f4e\uff0cP62\u86cb\u767d\u53camRNA\u6c34\u5e73\u5347\u9ad8\uff08P<0.05\uff09\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba: \n\u4f4e\u6c27\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cQGKSF\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u6291\u5236HIF-1\u03b1/BNIP3\u81ea\u566c\u4fe1\u53f7\u901a\u8def\u6765\u51cf\u5c11RANKL\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684RAW264.7\u5411\u7834\u9aa8\u7ec6\u80de\u5206\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u53d1\u6325\u6cbb\u7597RA\u9aa8\u7834\u574f\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002.\n\nDOI: 10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2025.07.05\nPMCID: PMC12268912\nPMID: 40673301 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no competing interests.\n\n\n20.

Despite advances in treatment, finding a \ncure or preventing disease progression remains a major clinical challenge, \nunderscoring the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. Among various \npathways involved in the pathophysiology of RA, the mitogen-activated protein \nkinases/extracellular regulated protein kinases (MAPK/ERK) pathway is of \nparticular importance. As the central cascade within the broader MAPK signaling \npathways, MAPK/ERK plays a critical role in regulating numerous physiological \nand pathological processes, with a well-established and prominent involvement in \nRA. Unlike p38 MAPK and c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), whose role in RA have \nbeen well-documented, the specific contributions of the MAPK/ERK pathway to RA \nremains comprehensively unreviewed. Furthermore, the MAPK/ERK pathway does not \nact in isolation but interacts synergistically with other major pathways, \nincluding NF-\u03baB, Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription \n(JAK/STAT), sonic hedgehog (SHH), and PI3K/AKT, which further enhance its \npathological effects. This review offers a comprehensive analysis of MAPK/ERK \nsignaling pathway, focusing on its molecular components and its contribution to \nRA pathophysiology.

The exact mechanisms \nunderlying AIDs pathogenesis remain unclear, and effective treatments are \ncurrently limited, posing significant therapeutic challenges. Recent studies \nsuggest that targeting T cell immune metabolism could be a promising approach \nfor treating AIDs. Repurposed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) medications, which \nmodulate immune metabolic processes, have shown potential in various \ninflammatory conditions. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, a \nnovel class of oral antidiabetic agents, not only regulate metabolic dysfunction \nbut also offer protective effects on the heart and kidneys. Emerging preclinical \nevidence indicates that SGLT2 inhibitors possess immunomodulatory properties, \nhighlighting their potential in enhancing T cell-mediated autoimmune therapy. \nClinical studies further validate that SGLT2 inhibitors significantly reduce the \nrisk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression in non-diabetic patient groups, \nsuch as those with chronic glomerulonephritis like IgA nephropathy. This review \naims to evaluate current preclinical and clinical research on the impact of \nSGLT2 inhibitors on the immune system and explore their mechanisms of action \nrelevant to treating AIDs.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Luo, Zhang, Tu, Li, Su, Gong, Huang, Li and Yang.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1589341\nPMCID: PMC12267200\nPMID: 40677716 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n22.

To this purpose, we characterized plasmatic \nextracellular vesicles (EVs) and their microRNA (miRNA) cargo in healthy and \npresymptomatic EAE mice early after exposure to PM10, compared to unexposed \nhealthy and EAE mice. Results showed that the response of EAE mice to PM10 did \nnot differ in terms of EV number or source, compared to that of healthy mice. \nYet, remarkable differences existed in the identity of deregulated EV-associated \nmiRNAs, which, in EAE mice, were predicted to target several MS-relevant \nbiological processes and nervous system-, immune- and inflammation-related \npathways, possibly contributing to disease worsening.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Bonato, Cerrato, Dioni, Montarolo, Parolisi, Bertolotto, \nBollati, Ferrari and Boda.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1596935\nPMCID: PMC12267195\nPMID: 40677715 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.

This scoping review aims to \nprovide a comprehensive description of the clinical features of ICI-associated \nIHA.\nMETHODS: PubMed and Web of Science Core Collection databases were searched for \narticles published in English from January 2006 to January 2025 on \nICI-associated IHA. Only full-text publications reporting the clinical \ncharacteristics of patients with ICI-associated IHA were included. Two authors \nindependently assessed the search results for eligibility and extracted the \nfollowing information: author, publication year, patient characteristics, and \nIHA features.\nRESULTS: Among 54 publications, published between July 2014 and March 2024, 92 \ncases of ICI-associated IHA were identified, revealing a high proportion of \ncases in patients with melanoma (45.2%) and non-small-cell lung cancer (31%). \nApproximately half of the cases occurred in patients receiving ICIs as \nfirst-line systemic therapy, with IHA manifesting after a median of 3 cycles. \nThe most frequent triggering ICIs were pembrolizumab (41.3%) and nivolumab \n(26.1%). A high proportion of cases involved patients with a medical history of \nhematolymphoid tumors (34.8%), hypertension (15.2%), and anemia/AIHA (15.2%). \nInitial management involved ICI discontinuation (94.6%), high-dose \nglucocorticoids therapy (97.8%), and transfusion support (63%), with treatment \nresponses achieved in most cases (91.3%). Only 2 cases reported fatal outcomes. \nIHA relapse was documented in only 7 of 23 (30.4%) patients who were \nrechallenged with an ICI.\nCONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest scoping review of \npopulation-based studies, case reports, and case series on ICI-associated IHA. \nThe evidence reviewed suggests that patients with specific comorbidities may be \nat higher risk of developing ICI-associated IHA. In the absence of predictive \ntools to individually estimate the risk of this complication, a list of \nfrequently reported co-occurring conditions in cases of ICI-associated IHA may \nhelp select patients who could benefit from closer surveillance.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Hernandez-Martinez, Rios-Garcia, Palomares-Palomares and \nArrieta.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1586426\nPMCID: PMC12268707\nPMID: 40677712 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as potential conflicts of interest.\n\n\n24.

Disease \nremission was determined using disease activity scales. Sustained remission was \ndefined as at least two consecutive visits in remission within the first 12 \nmonths of follow-up. Multivariate Cox regression was used to compare the \nprobability of achieving remission between ETA-B and ETA-O, and multivariate \nlogistic regression was used to assess sustained remission.\nRESULTS: We studied 150 participants with RA (ETA-B: 65.3%). Among 125 \nparticipants not in remission at baseline, the median time to first remission \nwas 8.7 months (95% confidence intervals [CI] 5.2-12.1) in the ETA-B group and \n14.5 months (95% CI 4.7-18.6) in the ETA-O group. Time to first remission was \nsimilar between the groups (log-rank test: P-value\u2009=\u20090.51). Multivariate Cox \nregression showed no clear difference in first remission between ETA-B and ETA-O \n(adjusted hazard ratio 1.52, 95% CI 0.68-3.39). Among 125 participants with at \nleast 12 months of follow-up, the prevalence of sustained remission was 19.5% \nfor ETA-B and 21.0% for ETA-O. In multivariate analysis, we did not detect a \nsignificant difference in sustained remission between ETA-B and ETA-O (adjusted \nodds ratio 1.14, 95% CI 0.29-4.87).\nCONCLUSION: We did not detect clear differences in first remission and sustained \nremission between participants with RA initiating ETA-B or ETA-O.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Not applicable.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Joachim.burman@uu.se.\n(#)Contributed equally\n\nBACKGROUND: Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) has been \nincreasingly used for treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis \n(RRMS). Existing data suggest that AHSCT might alter the natural course of \nmultiple sclerosis (MS) and postpone or even prevent the occurrence of \nprogressive MS. This study aimed to investigate whether three cerebrospinal \nfluid biomarkers of progressive MS: Galectin-9, GDF-15, and YKL-40, were \naffected by treatment intervention with AHSCT for RRMS.\nMETHODS: RRMS patients treated with AHSCT at Uppsala University Hospital between \n2011 and 2018 were considered for participation and included if CSF samples from \nbaseline and at least one follow-up were available. CSF from healthy volunteers \nwas included as controls. Galectin-9 and GDF-15 concentrations were determined \nwith ELISA, and YKL-40 with electrochemiluminescence.\nRESULTS: The final cohort comprised 45 RRMS patients and 32 controls. At \nbaseline, MS patients had markedly higher CSF concentrations of Galectin-9 and \nYKL-40 and slightly higher GDF-15 than controls. Following AHSCT, biomarker \nconcentrations decreased from baseline to the 1-year follow-up, with a median \n(IQR) of 454 (357-553) vs. 408 (328-495) pg/mL (P\u2009=\u20090.0002) for Galectin-9; 49 \n(38-79) vs. 45 (35 to 75) pg/mL (P\u2009=\u20090.012) for GDF-15, and 100 (54-164) vs. 58 \n(43-92) ng/mL (P\u2009<\u20090.0001) for YKL-40. Galectin-9 and YKL-40 concentrations \ndecreased further and were even lower at the 2-year follow-up; median (IQR) 408 \n(328-495) vs. 376 (289-478) pg/mL (P\u2009=\u20090.0009) for Galectin-9; and 62 (37-96) \nvs. 56 (30-83) ng/mL (P\u2009<\u20090.0001) for YKL-40. Thereafter, the levels of all \nbiomarkers were stable throughout the follow-up.\nCONCLUSION: Treatment with AHSCT was associated with sustained reductions in \nbiomarkers linked to progressive MS, indicating its potential not only to \nachieve lasting remission but also to delay or prevent transition to SPMS. \nHowever, additional studies are necessary to confirm these findings and \nelucidate their long-term clinical significance.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Hand sarcopenia in RA leads to functional deterioration and diminished \nquality of life. Although conventional methods, such as exercise and nutrition, \nare typically used, current evidence suggests that massage therapy may offer \nadvantages through anti-inflammatory, circulatory, and anabolic pathways. This \nhypothesis-driven article proposes that targeted hand massage may alleviate \nsarcopenia in RA by enhancing local perfusion, modulating immunological \nresponses, mitigating oxidative stress, and stimulating muscle-regenerative \npathways. Experimental investigations in animals and humans have demonstrated \nthat massage can activate mechanotransduction signaling, enhance muscle protein \nsynthesis, stimulate satellite cell activity, and reduce inflammatory mediators, \nincluding tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6. Moreover, enhancements \nin handgrip strength and muscle oxygenation have been documented after \nmechanical interventions. Small sample sizes, diverse methodologies, and the \nabsence of standardized massage procedures limit the clinical validity of the \ndata. Randomized controlled trials involving RA patients with compromised hand \nfunction and sarcopenia are necessary to explore this hypothesis. Standardized \noutcome measures, such as handgrip strength, disease activity scores, muscle \ntissue imaging, and inflammatory biomarkers, are required to assess efficacy. If \nverified, massage therapy may provide a non-invasive, low-risk complement to \nestablished care, potentially enhancing muscle function and quality of life in \nRA patients with sarcopenia.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

While gene therapy offers \na promising therapeutic approach, its effectiveness is limited by the challenges \nof non-specific gene expression in healthy tissues. Here, we develop a gene \ndelivery system (namely APPC), in which near-infrared (NIR)-responsive gold \nnanorods are coated with chondroitin sulfate-modified polyethyleneimine to \nfacilitate the heat-responsive targeted delivery of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) \ngene. The APPC shows favorable transfection efficiency due to its targeting \nability and significantly facilitates HO-1 expression under NIR irradiation. The \ncombination of APPC/pHO-1 and NIR can effectively reprogram the cellular \nmetabolism and repolarize the macrophages and fibroblast-like synoviocytes, \nthereby inhibiting inflammation by suppressing glycolysis. Meanwhile, APPC can \nspecifically enhance the HO-1 expression in inflamed tissues through \nNIR-mediated the activation of heat shock protein 70 promoter, ensuring the \nprecise gene expression via photothermal conversion. In a collagen-induced \narthritis model, APPC/pHO-1 under NIR irradiation exhibits potent therapeutic \nefficacy, restoring the articular microenvironmental homeostasis and mitigating \nthe symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. These findings highlight the potential of \nAPPC/pHO-1 nanoparticles in the gene therapy of rheumatoid arthritis and other \ninflammatory diseases.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

It can be divided by the presence of serum \nautoantibodies into two major categories where Immunoglobulin G (IgG) against \neither the acetylcholine receptor (AChR), or muscle specific kinase (MuSK) \ncauses fatigable muscle weakness. The clinical relevance of Low-density \nlipoprotein-receptor related protein-4 IgG (LRP4) is debated. These antibodies \ndisrupt neuromuscular transmission via different mechanisms: AChR antibodies, \nmostly of IgG1 and IgG3 subclass, can activate complement leading to a \nsimplification of the NMJ architecture, block acetylcholine binding to its \nreceptor to prevent channel opening, and internalize AChR. By contrast, MuSK \nantibodies, mostly of the IgG4 subclass, impair MuSK-LRP4 interactions, and LRP4 \nantibodies may interfere with agrin-induced clustering. Once these antibody \ntargets were identified the development of antibody assays began. Patrick and \nLindstrom made the landmark discovery that antibodies against soluble AChR \ncaused acute flaccid paralysis in immunized rabbits which kickstarted test \ndevelopment. The first, and until recently, most useful test was the \nradioimmunoassay (RIA) where AChR radiolabeled with toxin from venomous snakes \nallowed quantitative measurement of AChR-IgG. Most recently the clustered AChR \ncell-based assays (CBA) provide a significant improvement in test sensitivity \nover all other methods. MuSK assays followed a similar but shorter path. The \naccurate detection of AChR and MuSK antibodies has a crucial role in supporting \nthe clinical diagnosis and management of MG which includes a diverse population \nof patients with a wide range of clinical manifestations, disease severity and \nresponse to standard and new therapies. In this chapter we highlight how \ndistinct target-specific IgG autoantibodies cause neuromuscular transmission \ndefects, and subsequently shape disease manifestations in the different MG \nantibody subgroups. We review the evolution of diagnostic assays, from early RIA \nto modern CBA, and addresses interpretative pitfalls, particularly in borderline \nor \"seronegative\" cases. Finally, the authors address the significance of \naccurate autoantibody detection in the diagnosis and management of patients with \none of the antibody MG subtypes, as well as in patients with other autoimmune \nconditions and thymic malignancies.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

This organ creates a specialized \nenvironment for thymocyte differentiation and positive/negative selection, \nensuring the survival of functional and self-tolerant T cells while eliminating \nautoreactive clones. This process, which is known as T-cell education, involves \ninteractions between developing T cells and stromal cells, primarily thymic \nepithelial cells, which present tissue-specific antigens. Proper thymus function \nremains vital for maintaining immune homeostasis. However, thymic abnormalities \nhave been implicated in Myasthenia Gravis (MG), where the thymus often exhibits \nlymphofollicular hyperplasia or thymomas, which may trigger an autoimmune \nresponse against the acetylcholine receptor at the neuromuscular junction. This \nleads to impaired neuromuscular transmission and characteristic muscle weakness. \nUnderstanding the etiological mechanisms underlying thymic alterations \nassociated with MG is crucial for elucidating immune dysregulation resulting \nfrom an abnormal thymus, which may persist even post-therapeutic thymectomy.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

Like other autoimmune diseases, MG arises when the immune system \nfails to distinguish self from non-self, attacking and damaging normal tissues. \nThe pathological response involves not only B cells, responsible for \nautoantibody production, but also T cells, which provide essential support for B \ncell pathogenicity. While the precise triggers of this abnormal immune response \nremain undefined, MG is recognized as a multifactorial disease influenced by \nimmune dysregulation along with genetic and environmental factors. This chapter \nexplores the complex immunopathology of MG, highlighting how these factors \ncollectively contribute to disease development. We examine the physiological \ndevelopment of T and B cell compartments, the tolerance checkpoints designed to \nprevent autoimmunity, and the consequences of their failure. Finally, we discuss \nthe dysregulation of these cellular compartments in MG, emphasizing their roles \nin disease progression, the persistence of autoimmunity, and responses to \ntreatment.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

Here, we \ninvestigated the contribution of S. anginosus-derived extracellular vesicles \n(SA-EVs) to SLE progression, with an emphasis on lupus nephritis (LN). \nFifty-four SLE patients and 43 healthy controls (HC) were recruited. The faecal, \nblood and serum samples from participants were collected. SLE disease activity \n(SLEDA) was evaluated by the SLEDA Index (SLEDAI). Stool S. anginosus abundance \nwas quantified by quantitative PCR, NK cell activation by flow cytometry and \nserum proinflammatory cytokines profile by ELISA. Lupus-prone MRL/lpr mice were \norally administered SA-EVs to evaluate in vivo inflammatory responses, renal NK \ncell activation and renal histopathological changes. S. anginosus levels were \nsignificantly elevated in SLE patients relative to HC, positively correlated \nwith SLEDAI scores and NK cell cytotoxicity. In vitro, SA-EVs stimulation of \npatient NK cells significantly heightened proinflammatory mediator production \n(granzyme B, TNF-\u03b1), increased cytotoxicity and downregulated inhibitory \nreceptors (TIM-3, NKG2A, TIGIT) compared to control EVs from S. Salivarius \n(SS-EVs). Mechanistically, lipoteichoic acid (LTA) within SA-EVs engaged \nToll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) on NK cells, activating MyD88/NF-\u03baB signalling \npathway. In MRL/lpr mice, SA-EVs treatment increased renal immune complex \ndeposition, upregulated renal NK cell activation markers (NKp44, NKp46), and \nexacerbated LN pathology with greater immune cell infiltration and inflammatory \ncytokine levels. Furthermore, NK cell depletion with anti-NK1.1 antibodies \nsignificantly prolonged survival in SA-EVs administered mice. Thus, SA-EVs \nexacerbate SLE by hyperactivating NK cells via the TLR2-MyD88-NF-\u03baB pathway, \nleading to amplified systemic inflammation and aggravated LN. These findings \nunderscore the potential of targeting SA-EVs for therapeutic intervention in \nSLE.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

Although various environmental, \nhormonal, and genetic factors can contribute to disease pathogenesis, the cause \nof this disease is not known. Traditional treatment for this disease is centered \naround limiting inflammation using a variety of immunosuppresants including \nglucocorticosteroids as well as other therapeutics including anti-malarial \ndrugs. More recently, selective immunosuppresives and biologics including \nBelimumab, a BAFF monoclonal antibody, and Anifrolumab, a monoclonal antibody \nthat selectively binds to type 1 interferon receptor (INFAR1) blocking the \nbiological activity of type 1 IFN, have been used with various success. It \nshould be noted that BAFF is of particular relevance as signaling through BAFFR \nis a well characterized mechansim for non-canonical NF-\u03baB signaling. While the \ncanonical NF-\u03baB pathway has been well studied and reported, the role of the \nnon-canonical NF-\u03baB pathway has been less investigated as to its role in \nautoimmunity. This pathway has been implicated in influencing pro-inflammatory \nimmune responses while also regulating lymphocyte development. In this review, \nwe aim to provide clarity on the relationship between the non-canonical NF-\u03baB \npathway and the role it plays in pathogenesis of SLE. The objective of this \nreview is to summarize recent findings of the relationship of this pathway in \nautoimmunity and, more specifically, in lupus pathogenesis.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Montano, Allen and Reilly.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1588486\nPMCID: PMC12263575\nPMID: 40672954 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n34.

However, replicative senescence limits the quantity and quality of \nMSCs during population doublings in vitro. Transcription factor SOX4 is a \ncrucial regulator of cell fate and stemness. This study aims to explore the role \nof SOX4 in senescence of MSCs and enhance their therapeutic efficacy in systemic \nlupus erythematosus (SLE).\nMETHODS: In early-passage MSCs (P3), late-passage MSCs (P8), SOX4 downregulated \nP3-MSCs or SOX4 overexpressed P8-MSCs, cell morphology, mitochondrial reactive \noxygen species (mtROS), senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-Gal) \nactivity, cell proliferation rate, senescence-associated secretory phenotype \n(SASP) factors, cell cycle suppressors, the immunosuppressive effects on T cell \nactivation and proliferation and the expression levels of SOX4 were determined. \nImiquimod induced SLE mice were transplanted with P3-MSCs and P8-MSCs or control \nand SOX4 overexpressed P8-MSCs, and clinical symptoms were assessed.\nRESULTS: Compared to P3-MSCs, P8-MSCs display a senescent phenotype, increased \nmtROS, SA-\u03b2-Gal activity, SASP factors, and cell cycle suppressors p53, p21, and \np16. Additionally, P8-MSCs have a reduced immunosuppressive function on T cell \nactivation and proliferation, and express lower levels of SOX4. Downregulation \nof SOX4 in P3-MSCs promotes cellular senescence and impairs their \nimmunosuppressive function. Conversely, overexpression of SOX4 in P8-MSCs \nameliorates cellular senescence and enhances their immunosuppressive function. \nFurthermore, transplantation of P3-MSCs or SOX4-overexpressing P8-MSCs \ndemonstrates greater therapeutic significantly efficacy in SLE mice compared to \nP8-MSCs.\nCONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these findings suggest that downregulation of SOX4 \ninduces senescence in MSCs and impairs their immunosuppressive function. \nTargeting SOX4 in MSCs may therefore represent a promising therapeutic approach \nfor the treatment of SLE.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Telitacicept is a new \nstrategy for the treatment of SLE, inhibiting the maturity, proliferation and \ndifferentiation of B cells, and thus, reduces disease activity. However, the \neffectiveness and safety of telitacicept in patients with SLE are not yet \nestablished.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: Five English databases (Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, \nCochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index of Nursing and \nAllied Health Literature) and four Chinese databases (China National Knowledge \nInfrastructure, Wanfang Data, China Science and Technology Journal Database and \nSinomed) will be searched from database inception to 1 June 2025. Two \ninvestigators will independently conduct study selection, data extraction and \nquality assessment. Outcomes include disease activity, incidence of flares, \norgan damage, several immune-related laboratory parameters and adverse events. \nRisk ratio with 95% CI and mean difference or standardised mean difference will \nbe used as measures of effect sizes, in order to pool the data using either a \nrandom-effect model or fixed-effect model according to the heterogeneity of \nstudies. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis will be performed to explore \nthe source of heterogeneity and evaluate the robustness of the results. We will \nuse the Risk of Bias 2 tool and Risk of Bias In Non-Randomized Studies of \nInterventions tools to assess the quality of the included studies, and use the \nGRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) \nsystem to assess the certainty of evidence.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No ethical approval is required since this review is \nbased on previously published studies.

Anti-dsDNA antibodies were detected using IIF (EUROIMMUN, \nLuebeck, Germany), CLIA (YHLO, Shenzhen, China) and DLCM (Livzon, Zhuhai, \nChina). The sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC) of each \nmethod and combination were compared at the recommended manufacturer cut-offs. \nThe agreement between methods and the association between antibody levels and \nclinical characteristics including disease activity, complement levels and organ \ninvolvement were also evaluated.\nRESULTS: All methods exhibited high specificity, while IIF performed best \n(98.5%), significantly greater than CLIA (96.3%) and DLCM (96.6%) (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). \nCLIA demonstrated the highest sensitivity (48.1%), outperforming IIF (36.0%) and \nDLCM (41.4%) (p<0.001). Cohen's kappa indicated substantial positive agreement \nbetween DLCM and CLIA (\u03ba=0.67), and moderate agreement between IIF and the other \nmethods (\u03ba=0.52-0.55). Combining IIF with DLCM or CLIA improved diagnosis \nperformance, with IIF+CLIA achieving the highest sensitivity (54.0%), accuracy \n(74.1%) and AUC (0.75). Moreover, anti-dsDNA positivity was strongly associated \nwith lower complement levels (C3: 0.71 vs 0.90\u2009g/L in DLCM+ vs DLCM-, p<0.001) \nand moderate-severe disease activity (65.0% DLCM positive). DLCM uniquely \npredicted musculoskeletal involvement (55.3% vs 44.7%, p<0.01). However, the \ndiagnostic performance for renal involvement was limited (sensitivity 46.9%, \nspecificity 56.3%, AUC=0.52).\nCONCLUSIONS: DLCM demonstrated substantial agreement with CLIA and held \npotential for SLE diagnosis and monitoring. A multiassay strategy, using a \nsensitive assay like CLIA or DLCM for initial screening and a highly specific \nassay like IIF for confirmation, optimises diagnostic performance for anti-dsDNA \nantibody detection in SLE.\n\n\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

Venous blood was collected from the patients. We determined blood \nurea, creatinine (Cr), cystatin C (CYSC), and uric acid (UA) and calculated the \nNLR, MLR, and PLR.\nRESULTS: The NLR and MLR were significantly greater in the LN group compared to \nSLE group (p < 0.05). Spearman's correlation analysis demonstrated that MLR had \na positive correlation with UA (p < 0.05), while PLR ex-hibited a positive \ncorrelation with Cr and UA (p < 0.05). The NLR and MLR p-values were less than \n0.05, and the respective areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) \ncurves for each were 0.761 and 0.720.\nCONCLUSIONS: NLR and MLR are strongly related to renal injury in patients with \nLN. These ratios demonstrate a reasonable correlation with the commonly used \nmarkers of renal injury and have significant clinical value in evaluating \nimpaired renal function in such patients.\n\nDOI: 10.7754/Clin.Lab.2025.241217\nPMID: 40663085 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n39.

This study aimed to analyzed the profile of serum tumor markers in \nfour common autoimmune disease.\nMETHODS: Patients with dermatomyositis (DM, n\u2009=\u2009132), Systemic sclerosis (SSc, \nn\u2009=\u200977), Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, n\u2009=\u2009191), Rheumatoid arthritis (RA, \nn\u2009=\u2009160) and ovarian cancer (n\u2009=\u2009250) were included in this study. Twelve tumor \nmarkers (CA724, AFP, FRT, NSE, CA19-9, CA125, CYFRA21-1, CA153, \u03b2-HCG and HE4) \nlevels and abnormal rate in these patients were retrospective statistics. The \ntumor markers profiles were compared among the different AID.\nRESULTS: Compared with ovarian cancer (OV) patients, there were no significant \ndifferences for the levels and abnormal rates of CYFRA21-1/HE4/CA50/FRT in AID \npatients. The levels and abnormal rates of CA724/FRT/CA125/NSE were higher in OV \npatients than that in AID patients. 75% AID patients have at least one elevated \ntumor marker. 69.46% AID patients have 2-5 elevated tumor markers. All the 12 \ntumor markers were negative in 16.67, 19.74, 27.23 and 32.70% of DM, SSc, SLE \nand RA patients. Except CA50, the levels of the other eleven tumor markers were \nsignificantly different between DM/SSc/SLE/RA. Except AFP/\u03b2-HCG/SCC, the \nabnormal rate of the other tumor markers were significantly different between \nthese AID.\nCONCLUSIONS: The increased levels of tumor makers were common in four major AID, \nand the profile of tumor makers were significantly different among these AID.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

The \nSLICC-FI was assessed at baseline. Hospitalisations, their number as well as \ntheir duration (in days), were reported during the first 3 years from the \nbaseline visit. Univariable and multivariable negative binomial regressions were \nperformed to determine the association between the baseline SLICC-FI (per 0.05 \nincrease) and hospitalisations during follow-up (number and length), adjusted \nfor possible confounders. An alternative analysis was carried out after \nexcluding the damage-related deficits, rendering a modified SLICC-FI.\nRESULTS: Of the 295 patients included, 273 (92.5%) were female, with a mean (SD) \nage at diagnosis of 34.8 (13.5) years. At baseline, the mean SLICC-FI was 0.18 \n(0.05) with 86 (29.2%) patients categorised as being frail. The mean number of \nhospitalisations per patient-year was 0.4 (0.8) and the mean number of days \nhospitalised during the 3-year period per patient-year was 3.1 (7.6) days. The \nSLICC-FI predicted a higher number and days of hospitalisations (incidence rate \nratio (IRR): 1.671 (95% CI: 1.385 to 2.016) and IRR: 2.018 (95% CI: 1.715 to \n2.375), respectively). The modified SLICC-FI also predicted hospitalisations in \nboth number and days.\nCONCLUSION: The SLICC-FI predicted hospitalisations in patients with SLE, \nindependent of other well-known risk factors. Further studies are needed to \ndevelop strategies to improve frailty in these patients.\n\n\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No \ncommercial re-use.

Study assessments included brain MRI \nusing SyMRI and neuropsychological tests: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), \nMontreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Digit Span Test, Self-Rating Anxiety Scale \nand Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS). SyMRI post-processing and Automated \nAnatomical Labeling were used for grey matter mapping. Correlation analysis was \nperformed to assess the relationship between brain grey matter structural \nalterations and neuropsychological testing.\nRESULTS: 77 patients with SLE (57 non-neuropsychiatric SLE (non-NPSLE), 20 \nNPSLE) and 29 HC participants were enrolled. Patients with SLE showed reduced \ngrey matter volume compared with HC (p<0.05). The NPSLE group exhibited more \nextensive increases in longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) relaxation times in \ngrey matter than the non-NPSLE group (p<0.001). Proton density values were lower \nin patients with SLE (p<0.001). Lower brain parenchymal volume correlated with \nhigher SLE Disease Activity Index (p<0.05). Lower MMSE/MoCA scores correlated \nwith increased T1/T2 in the left medial cingulate and paracingulate gyri \n(p<0.05). Higher SDS scores correlated with increased T1/T2 in the left \ncalcarine fissure and surrounding cortex (p<0.05). These changes were also \nlinked to disease markers (C3, C4, immunoglobulin M, erythrocyte sedimentation \nrate) (p<0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Grey matter alterations in patients with SLE correlate with \ncognitive impairment, depression and disease activity.\n\n\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

While current treatments can somewhat control \ndisease progression, their long-term effectiveness remains limited, \nnecessitating the development of more effective therapeutic approaches. Lactate \nand lactylation are critical links between metabolic reprogramming and \nepigenetics. As an emerging epigenetic modification, lactylation induced by \nlactate is closely associated with the onset of autoimmune diseases. Lactylation \ncan be categorized into histone and nonhistone modifications, both of which play \npivotal roles in cellular functions and pathophysiological processes through \ndistinct regulatory mechanisms. Lactylation impacts immune cell function by \nregulating metabolic reprogramming and signaling pathways. In autoimmune \ndiseases, immune cell metabolic reprogramming controls lactylation levels \nthrough metabolic byproducts, and lactylation, in turn, modulates the cellular \nmetabolism by altering the transcription and structure of key enzymes. These \ninterconnected processes collectively drive disease progression. To better \nunderstand the role of lactate and lactylation in the pathogenesis of autoimmune \ndiseases, this review synthesizes the effects on specific immune cells, \nexamining their dual effects on immune system function and their particular \nimpacts on two common autoimmune diseases-rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic \nlupus erythematosus (SLE). By combining the established role of lactate in \nimmune metabolic reprogramming with the emerging understanding of the influence \nof lactate-induced lactylation on epigenetic regulation, this paper explores the \nrelationship between lactylation and the progression of autoimmune diseases. \nThis approach aims to enhance the understanding of the interplay between \nepigenetics and metabolism in autoimmune disease development, providing new \nperspectives for future therapeutic strategies. Studies collectively indicate \nthat treatment can be improved through regulating key enzymes involved in \nlactylation, targeting lactate production pathways, integrating innovative \napproaches with current therapies, and adopting personalized treatment \nstrategies.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Liu, Yang, Zhan, Yang, Zeng, Chen, Zeng, Hu, Hu, Xiao, Shao and \nChen.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1589853\nPMCID: PMC12245685\nPMID: 40655145 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n43.

This imbalance in the \nimmune system alters the body's defense capabilities against various pathogens. \nPatients with idiopathic CD4\u207a T lymphocytopenia (ICL) have a reduced number of \nlymphocytes, and the function of the immune system is also impaired. Human \npapillomavirus (HPV) infects human body and mainly lurks and replicates in skin \nand mucosal cells.\nCASE REPORT: A 35-year-old Chinese male was admitted to the Nephrology \ndepartment, with a three-year history of recalcitrant warts and a six-month \nhistory of generalized edema and fatigue. Physical examination identified \nverruca vulgaris on the limbs and face. Laboratory examinations demonstrated \nCD4\u207a T lymphocytopenia, low levels of C3 complement, and positive antinuclear \nantibodies. Renal function tests indicated nephrotic syndrome. Renal biopsy \nfindings were consistent with Class V lupus nephritis (LN). Based on the 2019 \nEULAR/ACR criteria, the patient was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus \n(SLE) and treated with prednisone and tacrolimus. However, after six months, no \nremission was observed. With the administration of Belimumab, a significant \nimprovement in his renal symptoms and stabilization of cutaneous lesions were \nnoted at the 12-month follow-up.\nCONCLUSION: This particular case emphasizes the significance of taking into \naccount the potential presence of underlying immunodeficiency in patients with \nrecalcitrant warts and formulating appropriate treatment strategies. Such \npatients necessitate meticulous and continuous follow-up by both the dermatology \nand immunology specialties to vigilantly monitor the emergence of other diseases \nassociated with ICL. Belimumab has manifested outstanding efficacy and safety \nprofiles in SLE patients with compromised immune function.\n\n\u00a9 2025.
