Reduction of maternal hyperglycemia prior to \nand during pregnancy can reduce these risks. Despite compelling evidence that \npreconception care (PCC), which includes achieving strict glycemic goals, \nreduces the risk of congenital malformations and other adverse pregnancy \noutcomes, only a minority of individuals receive PCC. Suboptimal pregnancy \noutcomes demonstrated in real-world data highlight the need to further optimize \nprenatal glycemia. New evolving technology shows promise in helping to achieve \nthat goal. Dysglycemia is not the only driver of poor pregnancy outcomes in PDM. \nThe increasing impact of obesity on pregnancy outcomes underscores the \nimportance of optimal nutrition and management of insulin sensitizing \nmedications during prenatal care for PDM.\nOBJECTIVE: To provide recommendations for the care of individuals with PDM that \nlead to a reduction in maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes.\nMETHODS: The Guideline Development Panel (GDP) composed of a multidisciplinary \npanel of clinical experts, along with experts in guideline methodology and \nsystematic literature review, identified and prioritized 10 clinically relevant \nquestions related to the care of individuals with diabetes before, during and \nafter pregnancy. The GDP prioritized randomized controlled trials (RCTs) \nevaluating the effects of different interventions (eg, PCC, nutrition, treatment \noptions, delivery) during the reproductive life cycle of individuals with \ndiabetes, including type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus \n(T2DM). Systematic reviews queried electronic databases for publications related \nto these 10 clinical questions. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, \nDevelopment, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty \nof evidence and develop recommendations. The approach incorporated perspectives \nfrom 2 patient representatives and considered patient values, costs and \nresources required, acceptability and feasibility, and impact on health equity \nof the proposed recommendations.\nRESULTS: In individuals with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of \nbecoming pregnant, we suggest asking a screening question about pregnancy \nintention at every reproductive, diabetes, and primary care visit. Screening for \npregnancy intent is also suggested at urgent care/emergency room visits when \nclinically appropriate (2 | \u2295OOO). This was suggested based on indirect evidence \ndemonstrating a strong association between PCC and both reduced glycated \nhemoglobin (HbA1c) at the first prenatal visit and congenital malformations.In \nindividuals with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of becoming \npregnant, we suggest use of contraception when pregnancy is not desired (2 | \n\u2295\u2295OO). This was suggested based on indirect evidence in women with diabetes, \nwhere PCC-including contraception as a key component-showed a clinically \nsignificant association with improvements in first-trimester HbA1c and the rate \nof congenital malformations, together with indirect evidence from the general \npopulation regarding the reduction of unplanned pregnancies and pregnancy \nterminations with the use of contraception.In individuals with T2DM, we suggest \ndiscontinuation of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) before \nconception rather than discontinuation between the start of pregnancy and the \nend of the first trimester (2 | \u2295OOO). This was suggested based on limited data \non risk of exposure to GLP-1RA receptor agonists during pregnancy.In pregnant \nindividuals with T2DM already on insulin, we suggest against routine addition of \nmetformin (2 | \u2295OOO). This was suggested based on the GDP judgment that the \nbenefit of adding metformin to insulin to achieve decrease in rates of large for \ngestational age infants did not outweigh the potential harm of increasing the \nrisk of small for gestational age infants or adverse childhood outcomes related \nto changes in body composition.In individuals with PDM, we suggest either a \ncarbohydrate-restricted diet (<175\u2005g/day) or usual diet (>175\u2005g/day) during \npregnancy (2 | \u2295OOO). This was suggested based on the GDP judgment that the \navailable evidence was limited and very indirect, resulting in significant \nuncertainty about the net benefits or harms. As such, the evidence was \ninsufficient to support a recommendation either for or against a carbohydrate \nintake cutoff of 175\u2005g/day.In pregnant individuals with T2DM, we suggest either \nthe use of a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) or self-monitoring of blood \nglucose (SMBG) (2 | \u2295OOO). There is lack of direct evidence supporting \nsuperiority of CGM use over SMBG for T2DM during pregnancy. There is indirect \nevidence supporting improved glucometrics with the use of CGM for individuals \nwith T2DM outside of pregnancy, substantial improvements in neonatal outcomes \nfor individuals with T1DM using CGM during pregnancy and the potential for \ndecreasing adverse pregnancy outcomes with improved glucometrics in individuals \nwith T2DM.In individuals with PDM using a CGM, we suggest against the use of a \nsingle 24-hour CGM target <140\u2005mg/dL (7.8\u2005mmol/L) in place of standard-of-care \npregnancy glucose targets of fasting <95\u2005mg/dL (5.3\u2005mmol/L), 1-hour postprandial \n<140\u2005mg/dL (7.8\u2005mmol/L), and 2-hour postprandial < 120 mg/dL (6.7\u2005mmol/L) (2 | \n\u2295OOO). This was suggested based on indirect evidence that associated adverse \npregnancy outcomes with a fasting glucose > 126\u2005mg/dL (7\u2005mmol/L).In individuals \nwith T1DM who are pregnant, we suggest the use of a hybrid closed-loop pump \n(pump adjusting automatically based on CGM) rather than an insulin pump with CGM \n(without an algorithm) or multiple daily insulin injections with CGM (2 | \u2295OOO). \nThis was suggested based on a meta-analysis of RCTs which demonstrated \nimprovement in glucometrics with increased time in range (MD +3.81%; CI -4.24 to \n11.86) and reduced time below range (MD -0.85%; CI -1.98 to 0.28) with the use \nof hybrid closed-loop pump technology.In individuals with PDM, we suggest early \ndelivery based on risk assessment rather than expectant management (2 | \u2295OOO). \nThis was suggested based on indirect evidence that risks may outweigh benefits \nof expectant management beyond 38 weeks gestation and that risk assessment \ncriteria may be useful to inform ideal delivery timing.In individuals with PDM \n(including those with pregnancy loss or termination), we suggest postpartum \nendocrine care (diabetes management), in addition to usual obstetric care (2 | \n\u2295OOO). As the postpartum period frequently overlaps with preconception, this was \nsuggested based on indirect evidence demonstrating a strong association between \nPCC and both reduced HbA1c at the first prenatal visit and congenital \nmalformations.\nCONCLUSION: The data supporting these recommendations were of very low to low \ncertainty, highlighting the urgent need for research designed to provide high \ncertainty evidence to support the care of individuals with diabetes before, \nduring, and after pregnancy. Investment in implementation science for PCC is \ncrucial to prevent significant mortality and morbidity for individuals with PDM \nand their children. RCTs to further define glycemic targets in pregnancy and \nrefinement of emerging technology to achieve those targets can lead to \nsignificant reduction of harm and in the burden of diabetes care. Data on \noptimal nutrition and obesity management in pregnancy are lacking. More research \non timing of delivery in women with PDM is also needed.\n\nThis article has been co-published with permission in European Journal of \nEndocrinology and The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism \u00a9 The \nAuthor(s) 2025.

They likewise defined \nhypothyroidism as hypothyroxinemia, assumed that almost all hypothyroidism was \nprimary, and relied upon the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) test and inactive \nprohormone thyroxine (T4) for diagnosis and treatment. The guidelines' authors \nacknowledged many TSH and other \"pitfalls\" in the paradigm yet warned physicians \nagainst attending to patients' signs and symptoms and relative free T4 (FT4) and \nfree triiodothyronine (FT3) levels-the only means by which to identify and avoid \nall pitfalls and provide individualized diagnosis and treatment. This inadequate \nparadigm has distorted medical practice and research for 50 years, including \nlaboratories' FT4 and FT3 reference ranges. It produces overdiagnosis, \nunderdiagnosis, inadequate treatment, and widespread patient dissatisfaction. \nSince the 1970s, our understanding of thyroid hormone production, transport, \nmetabolism, reception, and signaling has increased greatly, as has our \nappreciation of the importance of optimal T3 effects for health and wellbeing. \nHypothyroidism must be defined physiologically as insufficient T3 effect in some \nor all tissues. The best indicators of tissue T3 effect are the patient's signs \nand symptoms, and the best serum tests are FT4 and FT3, considered together. The \nTSH level is not a reliable indicator of T3 status in the untreated state and is \noversuppressed by the peak levels that occur with once-daily oral T4 and/or T3. \nNormalizing an elevated TSH or low FT4 with T4 usually does not produce \nsufficient, let alone optimal, T3 effect and can leave some patients markedly \nhypothyroid. T4/T3 combination therapy is more physiological and effective than \nT4 monotherapy and must be guided by clinical criteria, not the TSH. Some \npatients cannot tolerate more T3 effect due to hypocortisolism, inflammation, \nand other disorders. There is no substitute for the practice of fully informed \nclinical medicine.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Lindner.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fendo.2025.1529791\nPMCID: PMC12234311\nPMID: 40630099 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The author declares that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n3.

However, a small subset of pituitary tumours presents with multiple \nlocal recurrences or tumour progression despite combined surgical, medical or \nradiotherapeutic treatment. These are known as aggressive pituitary tumours \n(APT); also called aggressive pituitary neuroendocrine tumours (PitNETs); or, in \nthe rare case of metastases, pituitary carcinomas (PC) or metastatic PitNETs. \nEarly identification of APT is challenging but is of major clinical importance \nas they are associated with an increased morbidity and mortality even in the \nabsence of metastases. Here, we provide a revision of the first international, \ninterdisciplinary European Society of Endocrinology (ESE) clinical practice \nguideline on APTs and PC (2018). Since publication of the 2018 guideline, \nresults from the second ESE survey on APT and PC were published, and more data \non APT treatment, including temozolomide, immune checkpoint inhibitors and \nbevacizumab, emerged. These data are reviewed in this guideline and translated \ninto a practical algorithm to guide APT and PC management. Furthermore, \nstandardized reporting of imaging and histopathological investigations of these \ntumours is proposed, and the role of molecular analysis is discussed. Last, a \nsection is dedicated to special circumstances such as APT in pregnancy.\n\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2025.

Although required by major guidelines, little is known \nabout the current EMTB composition and working outcomes. The present study aims \nto analyse the use and support provided by an experienced EMTB, highlighting the \nskills of this board.\nMETHODS: This monocentric and retrospective study considered all the cases \ndiscussed (N=1038, concerning 835 patients) within the ETMB of Careggi \nUniversity Hospital of Florence from January 1st, 2021, to December 31st, 2023. \nThe queries have been standardised into five major groups. Besides treatment and \nfollow-up indications, particular attention has been paid to the need for \nrepeated discussions, additional indications, imaging revisions, and overall \nsurvival (OS) outcomes.\nRESULTS: Thyroid and rare cancers were the most frequently represented (64% and \n32%, respectively). At logistic regression analysis, the need for multiple \ndiscussions was associated with being a rare disease (p<0.001), familiar \nsyndrome (p=0.003), or adrenal masses (p=0.005). When the query was \"imaging \nreview,\" external imaging was more often re-evaluated (p=0.027) due to differing \nresults at EMTB revision, and in about 51% of these cases, further insights were \nrequested. Compared to external control groups, Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma and \nAdrenocortical Carcinoma showed improved OS, 7.84 vs 2.46 months (p=0.049) and \n51.92 vs 26.17 months (p=0.0076), respectively. From the hormonal perspective, \nfurther hormonal investigations were required in about 16% of eligible cases.\nCONCLUSIONS: EMTB is pivotal in managing and optimising common and rare \nendocrine tumour workups.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Sparano, Canu, Perigli, Santoro, Pradella, Grazzini, Mangoni, \nSimontacchi, Fibbi, Vezzosi, Olianti, Maggi and Petrone.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fendo.2025.1513893\nPMCID: PMC12148920\nPMID: 40496560 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.

The objective of this study \nwas to evaluate current practices in managing GD when complicated by \nmoderate-to-severe TED worldwide. Methods: We recently reported results from a \nglobal online survey of endocrinologists comparing the management of GD in \ndifferent scenarios. The current analysis focuses on regional differences in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of GD when complicated by TED. Results: A total of 1252 \nrespondents from 85 countries completed the survey. Regarding the initial \ndiagnostic and treatment measures, there were no differences among the various \ngeographical regions. Regarding the treatment of moderate-to-severe TED, the use \nof sodium selenite was higher in Europe (66.5%) and Oceania (60%) compared to \nother regions (p < 0.001). North American respondents were more likely to \nrecommend teprotumumab and less likely to use glucocorticoids (p < 0.001). When \ncomparing the treatment options for GD in patients with TED, although prolonged \nuse of antithyroid drugs (ATD) remained the first choice in all regions, \nrespondents from Europe, North America, and Oceania were more likely to \nrecommend thyroidectomy than those from other regions (p < 0.001). \nOphthalmologists, rather than endocrinologists, would more often be responsible \nfor prescribing advanced medical therapy for TED in North America, Oceania, and \nAfrica, while endocrinologists would have primary responsibility in other \nregions of the globe. Conclusions: Although there are regional differences, \nrespondents generally employ the recommended diagnostic tools, treatments, and a \nmultidisciplinary approach suggested by current clinical practice guidelines. \nHowever, there were examples of deviations from current guidance from \nprofessional societies.\n\nDOI: 10.1089/thy.2024.0759\nPMCID: PMC12223373\nPMID: 40432588 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n9.

The collection highlights the advances in the understanding of the \nstructure, ligand interactions, and crosstalk with other signaling pathways. It \nreports ongoing research, which continues to reveal the complexity and \nphysiological relevance of nuclear thyroid hormone receptor (TR) functions in \ntissues. Despite progress, key questions remain about cell-specific gene \nregulation, negative feedback mechanisms, and TR involvement in cancer. The new \ncollection of review articles published in Endocrinology represents a milestone \nin a long-term project that illustrates the diversity of information that \nTR-centered research brings to basic science. They also outline that there is \nplenty of room for new and exciting investigations.\n\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2025. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the \nEndocrine Society.

Endocrinology and cardiology care \nmay improve outcomes for these patients, but access to this care is limited for \nmany patients by practitioner shortages in rural areas and other barriers.\nOBJECTIVE: To assess associations of geographic and sociodemographic factors \nwith endocrinology and cardiology care receipt among adults with type 2 diabetes \nand atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease before and after widespread \ntelemedicine uptake.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used \nelectronic medical record and public geographic and infrastructure data at a \nlarge health system spanning urban and rural counties in Pennsylvania. \nParticipants were adults with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular \ndisease who received primary care from January 2018 to June 2022.\nEXPOSURES: Patient-level geographic measures, including distance to clinic, \npublic transit, and cellular data access, and sociodemographic factors, \nincluding age, gender, race, and neighborhood socioeconomic status.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was at least 1 outpatient visit \nwith endocrinology or cardiology. Geospatial analysis assessed patient-level \ngeographic factors using zip code centroids, and separate multivariable logistic \nregression models evaluated associations between variables and endocrinology and \ncardiology care receipt. Analyses were stratified by period before (January 1, \n2018, to March 15, 2020) and after (March 16, 2020, to June 30, 2022) COVID-19 \npandemic-related telemedicine uptake; mixed-effects models tested for \ndifferences between periods.\nRESULTS: Of 9546 adults (mean [SD] age, 68.5 [10.0] years; 5854 male [61%]; 82 \nAsian [1%]; 930 Black [10%]; 8451 White [89%]; 7877 urban [83%]), 1747 received \nendocrinology care and 5578 received cardiology care. In the pretelemedicine \nperiod, distance to endocrinology clinic (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] per 10 \nmiles, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.64-0.84) and older age (aOR per 10 years, 0.70; 95% CI, \n0.66-0.75) were associated with lower odds of receiving endocrinology care. In \nthe posttelemedicine period, the aOR for distance to clinic increased, but that \nfor older age decreased. Black patients were less likely than White patients to \nreceive cardiology care in the pretelemedicine period (aOR, 0.71; 95% CI, \n0.60-0.82), and this association persisted in the posttelemedicine period.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of adults with type 2 diabetes \nand atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, geographic and sociodemographic \nfactors were associated with receipt of endocrinology and cardiology care. \nWidespread availability of telemedicine may enhance equitable access to \nendocrinology care for patients facing geographic barriers, but disparities in \nuse of specialty care by age and race persisted in the posttelemedicine period.\n\nDOI: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.11559\nPMCID: PMC12093186\nPMID: 40392552 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Johnson \nreported receiving grant K23HL165110 from the National Institutes of Health \noutside the submitted work.

The aim was to assess the landscape and \nsharing capacities between endocrine researchers.\nDESIGN: A standardized survey (SurveyMonkey\u00ae) with 67 questions was sent to \nEuropean Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumors centers.\nMETHODS: Answers were counted as absolute numbers and percentages. Comparisons \nbetween inclusiveness target countries (ITC) and non-ITC (defined by Cooperation \nin Science & Technology Action) were performed using Fisher's exact test.\nRESULTS: Seventy-three centers from 34 countries answered the survey. Electronic \nhealth record (EHR) systems are now the main source of data (90%). However, \nsignificant variability was reported, entailing >35 EHR providers, and variable \ndata collected. Variable stakeholders' implication for enabling data sharing was \nreported, with more lawyers (P = .023), patient representatives (P < .001), \nethicists (P = .002), methodologists (P = .023), and information technology \nexperts (P < .001) in non-ITC centers. Implication of information technologies \nexperts for data collection and sharing was underwhelming (33%). Funding for \nclinical research was higher in non-ITC than in ITC for clinical trials (P = \n.01) and for registry-based and cohort studies (P = .05). However, for \nretrospective studies addressing a specific clinical question, the funding was \neither very low (<10%) or nonexistent for both ITC and non-ITC (37% and 46%, \nrespectively), with no dedicated funding for information technology (86%) and \nethical and regulatory aspects (88%).\nCONCLUSIONS: In the absence of dedicated funding for retrospective research, \ncurrent requirements for data sharing are obstacles.\n\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2025.

While most individuals \nrecover HPGA function following androgen cessation, a subset experiences \nprolonged hypogonadism, with symptoms persisting for months or even years. \nCurrently, this condition lacks a standardized definition, complicating both \ndiagnosis and treatment. In this article, we explore the potential mechanisms \nunderlying prolonged hypogonadism after androgen abuse, including the role of \nprolonged androgen activity, hypothalamic-pituitary alterations, testicular \nchanges, suppression of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), genetic \npredisposition, and undisclosed ongoing androgen abuse. We propose the term \n'Prolonged Post-Androgen Abuse Hypogonadism'(PPAAH) to standardize diagnosis and \nguide future research. PPAAH is provisionally defined as persistent hypogonadism \nsix months after cessation of androgen abuse, in individuals with a cumulative \nandrogen exposure of at least 150 mg per week for a minimum of six months. \nDiagnosing PPAAH requires excluding other causes of hypogonadism. This \npreliminary framework is intended to support further research into the \npathophysiology and management of this condition, and may require refinement as \nfurther evidence emerges.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 van Os, Smit, Bond and de Ronde.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fendo.2025.1621558\nPMCID: PMC12267013\nPMID: 40678315 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n14.

Activation of the transient receptor \npotential vanilloid subtype 1 (TRPV1) cascade plays a key role in lipid \nmetabolism and energy intake. TRPV1 is expressed across the central nervous \nsystem and peripheral organs is involved in the regulation of hormone secretion, \nappetite and mitochondrial function, and is recognized as one of the key targets \nfor preventing obesity. The current treatments for obesity exhibit limited \nefficacy and are associated with numerous side effects. Targeting TRPV1 \nrepresents a potentially effective approach for managing obesity. In this work, \nby combining the recent mechanism of the role of TRPV1 in neuroendocrine \nregulation, we hope to provide novel approaches to block or even reverse the \ndevelopment of obesity.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Wang, Liu, Wen, Xing, Chen, Xia and Ding.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1598804\nPMCID: PMC12267016\nPMID: 40677717 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n15.

Tribulus Terrestris (TT) is recognized for \nits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This study aims to evaluate \nthe effects of TT extract on ovarian tissue damage induced by cisplatin.Material \nand MethodTwenty-five female BALB/c mice were divided into five groups (n = 5): \nControl, CIS (Cisplatin only), CIS + TT100 (100\u00a0mg/kg TT extract daily + CIS), \nCIS + TT300 (300\u00a0mg/kg TT + CIS), and CIS + TT500 (500\u00a0mg/kg TT daily + CIS). \nAfter 15 days, blood samples were collected for hormonal analysis, and ovaries \nwere harvested for histopathological, immunohistochemical, and biochemical \nassessments.ResultsThe CIS group exhibited a significant decline in follicle \ncount compared to the control group (P < 0.001). In contrast, the CIS + TT \ngroups showed a notable increase in follicle count (P < 0.05). TT treatment also \nresulted in significant improvements in antioxidant markers (SOD, CAT) and a \nreduction in oxidative stress (MDA) compared to the CIS group. Moreover, E2, \nAMH, and progesterone concentrations were decreased in the CIS group, while \nthese levels were restored in the TT-treated groups (P < 0.001). The expression \nof inflammatory markers TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 was higher in the CIS group and \ndecreased in the TT-treated groups.ConclusionTribulus Terrestris extract \neffectively mitigates cisplatin-induced ovarian toxicity by enhancing follicular \ncount, improving antioxidant activity, and reducing oxidative stress. TT \ntreatment also elevated AMH and progesterone levels while decreasing \ninflammatory markers, underscoring its potential as a protective agent against \ncisplatin-induced ovarian damage.\n\nDOI: 10.1177/09603271251353492\nPMID: 40676950 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe \nauthor(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the \nresearch, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\n\n16.

The AHR is known to crosstalk with hypoxia-inducible \nfactor 1\u03b1 (HIF1\u03b1) in other cell types but AHR-HIF1\u03b1 crosstalk has not been \npreviously examined in islet cells. Islet cell function is sensitive to hypoxia; \nwe hypothesize that AHR activation by environmental pollutant(s) will interfere \nwith the HIF1\u03b1 pathway response in islets, which may be detrimental to islet \ncell function and survival during periods of hypoxia.\nMETHODS: We assessed AHR-HIF1\u03b1 crosstalk by treating human donor islets and stem \ncell-derived islets (SC-islets) with 10\u2009nM TCDD\u2009\u00b1\u20091% O2 and measuring gene \nexpression of downstream targets of AHR (e.g. CYP1A1) and HIF1\u03b1 (e.g. HMOX1).\nRESULTS: In SC-islets, co-treatment with TCDD\u2009+\u2009hypoxia consistently suppressed \nCYP1A1 induction compared with TCDD treatment alone. In human islets, \nTCDD\u2009+\u2009hypoxia co-treatment suppressed CYP1A1 induction, but only in 2 of 6 \ndonors. Both SC-islets and human donor islets displayed hypoxia-mediated \nsuppression of glucose-6-phosphate catalytic subunit 2 (G6PC2) expression. \nGlucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in human donor islets was impaired \nby hypoxia exposure, but unaffected by TCDD exposure.\nCONCLUSION: Our study shows consistent AHR-HIF1\u03b1 crosstalk in SC-islets and \nvariable crosstalk in primary human islets, depending on the donor. In both cell \nmodels, hypoxia exposure interfered with activation of the AHR pathway by TCDD \nbut there was no evidence that AHR activation interfered with the HIF1\u03b1 pathway. \nIn summary, our data show that co-exposure to an environmental pollutant and \nhypoxia results in molecular crosstalk in islets.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/19382014.2025.2526871\nPMID: 40676831 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n17.

Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play an important role in the \nregulatory mechanisms controlling apoptosis within ovarian granulosa cells \n(GCs).\nMETHODS: The circular structure of circVEGFA was validated by RNase R and \nactinomycin D treatments. The function of circVEGFA during apoptosis in GCs was \ninvestigated by si-RNA transfection. Furthermore, competitive binding of \ncircVEGFA and TMX4 to miR-21-3p was confirmed by a dual-luciferase reporter gene \nassay and co-transfection with their inhibitors or siRNA.\nRESULTS: In this study, we present a novel circular RNA (circRNA), circVEGFA, \nwhich shows significantly reduced expression in atretic follicles (AFs) compared \nto healthy follicles (HFs).\nCONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates that circVEGFA increases TMX4 expression and \ninhibits apoptosis in GCs through competitive binding to miR-21-3p.

However, its impact on \nreproductive maturation remains poorly understood. In this study, the effects of \nchronic circadian disruption, induced by the 223 light regimen (two days of \nconstant light, two days of constant darkness, and three days of a 14:10\u00a0h \nlight-dark cycle), were examined in juvenile and peripubertal male rats \n(postnatal days 21-49). Gene expression profiles associated with Leydig cell \nmaturation, including steroidogenic, mitochondrial, and clock-related genes, as \nwell as markers of germ cell differentiation, were analyzed alongside functional \nmitochondrial parameters in Leydig cells. Under control conditions, Leydig cell \nmaturation was marked by increased expression of core clock genes, steroidogenic \nenzymes (Star, Cyp11a1, Hsd3b1/2), and mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics \nmarkers (Tfam, Nrf1, Cytc, Opa1, Mfn2). These transcriptional changes coincided \nwith rising mitochondrial content, membrane potential, ATP levels, serum \nandrogens, and progression of spermatogenesis. Conversely, the 223-regimen \ndisrupted behavioral rhythms, reduced circulating melatonin, blunted expression \nof maturation-associated genes, and shifted the acrophase of key steroidogenic \nand circadian transcripts in 49-day-old rats, indicating altered Leydig cell \nrhythmicity. These molecular disruptions were accompanied by decreased \ntestosterone levels, altered expression of spermatid differentiation genes (Tnp1 \nand Prm2), and a reduction in the number of elongated spermatids at stage VII of \nspermatogenesis. In conclusion, circadian misalignment disrupts endocrine and \ntranscriptional coordination during Leydig cell development, underscoring the \nvulnerability of pubertal reproductive maturation to environmental light \ndisturbances.\n\nPublisher: Not applicable.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) is considered one of the most useful \nmarkers of the quantity of the ovarian reserve; however, a more accurate \nprediction method is required. Furthermore, there is no clinically useful tool \nto assess the quality of the ovarian reserve and therefore a prediction tool is \nrequired. Our aim is to produce a model for prediction of the ovarian reserve \nthat contributes to preconception care and precision medicine.\nMETHODS: This study was a retrospective analysis of 442 patients undergoing \nassisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment in Japan from June 2021 to \nJanuary 2023. Medical records and residual serum of patients undergoing oocyte \nretrieval were collected. Binary classification models predicting the ovarian \nreserve were created using machine learning methods developed with many \ncollected feature values. The best-performing model among 15 examined models was \nselected based on its area under the receiver operating characteristic curve \n(AUC) and accuracy. To maximize performance, feature values used for model \ncreation were narrowed down and extracted.\nRESULTS: The best-performing model to assess the quantity of the ovarian reserve \nwas the random forest model with an AUC of 0.9101. Five features were selected \nto create the model and consisted of data from only medical records. The \nbest-performing model to assess the quality of the ovarian reserve was the \nrandom forest model, which had an AUC of 0.7983 and was created with 14 \nfeatures, data from medical records and residual serum analysis.\nCONCLUSION: Our models are more accurate than currently popular methods for \npredicting the ovarian reserve. Furthermore, they can assess the ovarian reserve \nusing only information obtained from a medical interview and single blood \nsampling. Enabling easy measurement of the ovarian reserve with this model would \nallow a greater number of women to engage in preconception care and facilitate \nthe delivery of personalized medical treatment for patients undergoing \ninfertility therapy.\nCLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Outside the nervous system, \nLRRK2 is expressed in multiple tissues, including the endocrine pancreas, but \nits role here is unknown. Using pharmacological and molecular approaches, we \nshow that LRRK2 kinase activity regulates stimulated insulin secretion by \ninfluencing secretory granule trafficking. The PD-associated LRRK2 mutant \nG2019S, characterized by enhanced kinase activity, increases the basal insulin \nrelease in complementary in vitro models and affects the metabolic profile in \ntransgenic mice. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that LRRK2 kinase activity \ninfluences the formation of the primary cilium, an antenna-like structure acting \nas signaling platform to regulate hormones secretion. Specifically, LRRK2 \nphosphorylates RAB8 in a glucose-dependent manner, facilitating its recruitment \nto the primary cilium. These findings identify LRRK2 as a regulator of insulin \nsecretion in pancreatic \u03b2-cells. Given the role of insulin signaling and glucose \nhomeostasis in the nervous system, our data suggest that LRRK2 may also \ncontribute to PD development through peripheral action.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Although EVs from the male reproductive tract \nhave been extensively studied for their role in sperm maturation, research on \nfemale reproductive tract-derived EVs in humans is still emerging and supported \nby only a few studies to date. In vitro study was performed using spermatozoa \nfrom normozoospermic men and EVs isolated from follicular fluid (FF-EVs), \ncervicovaginal fluid collected 2 and 7 days after the LH surge (CVF-EVs LH\u2009+\u20092 \nand LH\u2009+\u20097, respectively) and spent medium of decidualized (dESCs-EVs) and \nnon-decidualized (eESCs-EVs) endometrial stromal cells from healthy women of \nreproductive age. The principal outcome measures comprise the percentage of \nviable, progressively motile, and capacitated spermatozoa after treatment with \nFF-EVs, CVF-EVs LH\u2009+\u20092 and LH\u2009+\u20097, dESCs-EVs, and eESCs-EVs. Spermatozoa are \nable to capture EVs derived from all the considered tracts of the female \nreproductive system, with slightly varying efficiencies, albeit comparable in \nmost cases. Incubating sperm cells with any of these EVs does not have any \ndetrimental effect on sperm vitality, increases the percentage of spermatozoa \ndisplaying progressive motility and the percentage of acrosome-reacted \nspermatozoa. EVs produced and released in various regions of the female \nreproductive system likely contribute to spermatozoa maturation during their \ntransit, promoting both capacitation and motility.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

For the relative Doppler area of the testicular parenchyma (p\u2009=\u20090.4) \nand plexus (p\u2009=\u20090.1), values were decreased at 16\u00a0months of age, but without a \ndifference between systems. For the velocimetric indices of the supratesticular \nartery, there were decreases in the pulsatility index (p\u2009=\u20090.3) and resistance \nindex (p\u2009=\u20090.04), with no difference between the production systems. In \nconclusion, the variations observed in the present study are more related to \nage. Thus, there are no differences in the characteristics observed by \nultrasound in young bulls kept in different microclimatic conditions under the \ncircumstances studied.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

The \nrelationship between adherence to the lifestyle modification intervention (diet \nand physical activity) and sociodemographic characteristics will be explored by \nmultivariable linear regression. The qualitative study will explore how gender, \nsocial class, and other factors (such as social and family support, knowledge \nabout one's health condition, health beliefs, and patient-professional \nrelationship) can influence adherence to lifestyle changes in a selected \nsubgroup of individuals.

Its \nonset is closely associated with insulin resistance, insufficient compensatory \nfunction of \u03b2 - cells, and abnormal placental function. Epidemiological studies \nhave indicated that type 2 diabetes is an independent risk factor for breast \ncancer. However, the association between GDM and the risk of breast cancer \nremains controversial.\nOBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to comprehensively \nevaluate the association between GDM and the risk of breast cancer and explore \nits underlying mechanisms.\nMETHODS: This study systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, \nEMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases, covering the period from \nestablishing each database until April 14, 2025. Two researchers extracted \nrelevant data and assessed the quality of included studies using the \nNewcastle-Ottawa Scale. The study evaluated inter-study heterogeneity using the \nI\u00b2 statistic. Based on the magnitude of heterogeneity, fixed-effect or \nrandom-effect models were employed to calculate the pooled hazard ratio (HR) and \nits corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Additionally, subgroup analyses, \nsensitivity analyses, funnel plot analyses, and publication bias assessments \nwere performed. All data analyses were conducted using STATA 17 software.\nRESULTS: The overall analysis revealed no significant association between GDM \nand breast cancer risk (HR=1.03, 95%CI: 0.92-1.15). However, subgroup analysis \nrevealed significant regional heterogeneity: within the regional subgroups, \nNorth American results showed an association between GDM and a reduced breast \ncancer risk (HR=0.89, 95%CI: 0.84-0.95), whereas Asian findings suggested an \nassociation with an increased risk (HR=1.23, 95%CI: 1.15-1.31). No significant \nassociations were observed in subgroups based on study design \n(cohort/case-control) or follow-up duration (short-term/long-term). Sensitivity \nanalysis demonstrated robust results, and there was no publication bias in this \nstudy.\nCONCLUSION: In summary, there is no significant association between GDM and \nbreast cancer risk overall. However, notable regional heterogeneity exists: in \nthe North American subgroup, GDM is associated with a reduced risk of breast \ncancer, while in the Asian subgroup, GDM is significantly associated with an \nincreased risk of breast cancer.\nSYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/, identifier \nCRD420251032589.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Li, Li, Jin, Zhang, Li, Xu, Wang, Hu, Wang and Yu.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fendo.2025.1621932\nPMCID: PMC12267041\nPMID: 40678319 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n25.

This study assessed neonatologists' knowledge, attitudes, \nand practices (KAP) regarding GDM-related complications in offspring.\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study of 1,614 neonatologists in Hubei Province, \nChina, utilized a validated 28-item questionnaire examining knowledge (12 \nitems), attitudes (8 items), and practices (8 items). Responses were scored on a \ntrichotomous scale. Binary logistic regression analyzed predictors of \nsatisfactory performance across domains.\nRESULTS: Among 1,614 neonatologists, 1,437 (89%) demonstrated satisfactory \nknowledge, 1,513 (94%) positive attitudes, and 1,165 (72%) good practices. \nKnowledgeable practitioners were significantly older (45.4 vs 36.2 years; OR \n1.42 [95% CI 1.40-1.44]; p<.001) with greater experience (13.8 vs 10.5 years; \n1.41 [1.35-1.46]; p<.001). Academic hospital affiliation showed higher \ncompetency versus community settings (0.12 [0.08-0.20]; p<.001). Practice \npatterns varied by education, with MD-PhD holders demonstrating higher odds of \ngood practice (1.32 [1.03-1.71]; P=.032) compared with fellowship training (0.69 \n[0.51-0.92]; p=.009). Universal documentation of maternal GDM coexisted with \nsuboptimal rates of periodic evaluations (81%) and specialist referrals (84%). \nKnowledge competency (7.52 [5.90-9.60]; p<.001) and positive attitudes (15.81 \n[9.90-25.26]; p<.001) strongly predicted practice patterns.\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite high knowledge levels and positive attitudes, particularly \namong experienced practitioners in academic settings, implementation gaps exist \nin follow-up protocols and specialist referrals.

This study evaluated patient-level \noutcomes of a diabetes support coach (DSC) intervention aimed at improving \nunderserved adults' diabetes technology use, diabetes distress, and HbA1c \nlevels. Methods: As part of a Project Extension for Community Healthcare \nOutcomes (ECHO) Diabetes program, a social support intervention involving 28 \nDSCs was piloted at 33 Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) in Florida and \nCalifornia from May 2021 to May 2022. DSCs, who were adults with diabetes, \nserved in a capacity similar to peer mentors and community health workers and \nreceived uniform training/oversight by a clinical team. Intervention \nparticipants (n = 74 adults with insulin-requiring diabetes at FQHCs) \nself-enrolled and engaged with DSCs via text messages, phone calls, and events. \nParticipants' outcomes were evaluated cross-sectionally via the Diabetes \nDistress Scale (DDS-17) and a diabetes technology usage survey and \nlongitudinally via HbA1c tests upon enrollment and at 6-month follow-up. A group \nof adults with insulin-requiring diabetes from the same FQHCs who did not \nreceive the DSC intervention (n = 363) was used for comparison. Descriptive \nstatistics were computed for all outcomes (n, percentage; mean, SD/95% CI). \nBetween-group comparisons were evaluated via chi-squared and t-tests. Results: \nDSC intervention participants reported significantly lower diabetes distress \nthan the comparison group (DDS-17 score mean = 1.6 vs. 2.1, p < 0.001), and \nsignificantly more participants in the DSC intervention regularly used \ncontinuous glucose monitors (CGMs) than the comparison group (69.9% vs. 38.8%, p \n< 0.0001). There were no significant differences in insulin pump usage or HbA1c. \nConclusions: Lower diabetes distress and greater CGM usage among intervention \nparticipants suggest that the DSCs' shared lived experiences and healthcare \nnavigation support positively influenced underserved adults' outcomes. These \nfindings show DSCs' potential for improving diabetes care and technology equity.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Jennifer Maizel et al.

The exact mechanisms \nunderlying AIDs pathogenesis remain unclear, and effective treatments are \ncurrently limited, posing significant therapeutic challenges. Recent studies \nsuggest that targeting T cell immune metabolism could be a promising approach \nfor treating AIDs. Repurposed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) medications, which \nmodulate immune metabolic processes, have shown potential in various \ninflammatory conditions. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, a \nnovel class of oral antidiabetic agents, not only regulate metabolic dysfunction \nbut also offer protective effects on the heart and kidneys. Emerging preclinical \nevidence indicates that SGLT2 inhibitors possess immunomodulatory properties, \nhighlighting their potential in enhancing T cell-mediated autoimmune therapy. \nClinical studies further validate that SGLT2 inhibitors significantly reduce the \nrisk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression in non-diabetic patient groups, \nsuch as those with chronic glomerulonephritis like IgA nephropathy. This review \naims to evaluate current preclinical and clinical research on the impact of \nSGLT2 inhibitors on the immune system and explore their mechanisms of action \nrelevant to treating AIDs.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Luo, Zhang, Tu, Li, Su, Gong, Huang, Li and Yang.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1589341\nPMCID: PMC12267200\nPMID: 40677716 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n29.

Patients were \ndivided into an infection group (70 cases) and a non-infection group (74 cases) \nbased on the presence of infection. The infection group was further categorized \ninto mild (29 cases), moderate (18 cases), and severe infection (23 cases) \nsubgroups according to infection severity. Serum levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and \nIFN-\u03b3 in DFI patients were analyzed, and their predictive value for treatment \noutcomes was evaluated.\nRESULTS: Serum levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b3 were significantly higher in the \ninfection group than in the non-infection group (P<0.05). Moreover, there were \nsignificant differences in TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b3 levels among patients with \nmild, moderate, and severe infections (P<0.05). ROC curve analysis demonstrated \nthat the area under the curve (AUC) for the combined detection of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, \nand IFN-\u03b3 in assessing DFI severity was 0.855, which was significantly higher \nthan that of TNF-\u03b1 (0.811), IL-6 (0.793), and IFN-\u03b3 (0.764) (P<0.05). \nFurthermore, serum levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b3 were significantly higher in \nthe poor prognosis group than in the good prognosis group (P<0.05). ROC curve \nanalysis showed that the AUC for predicting poor prognosis in DFI patients was \n0.926 when TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b3 were combined, which was significantly higher \nthan that of TNF-\u03b1 (0.849), IL-6 (0.834), and IFN-\u03b3 (0.809) (P<0.05).\nCONCLUSION: Serum levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b3 are elevated in DFI patients \nand are closely associated with infection severity and prognosis. The combined \ndetection of these three inflammatory factors can serve as a predictive \nindicator for infection severity and poor prognosis in DFI patients.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Wang, Gao, Qin, Li, Wang and Xie.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fcimb.2025.1606612\nPMCID: PMC12267273\nPMID: 40677522 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n30.

Conclusions: HbA1c level \u22657.5% \nwould increase the risk for microangiopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes \nmellitus, the higher the level, the higher the risk, and HbA1c level \u22658.5% would \nincrease the risk for macrovascular lesions and diabetic foot. It is necessary \nto strengthen the health education in diabetic patients to improve their \nawareness of blood glucose management and the importance of HbA1c level control \nto effectively reduce or delay the diabetes complications.\n\nPublisher: \u76ee\u7684\uff1a \u63a2\u8ba8\u4e2d\u56fd11\u4e2a\u77012\u578b\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u7cd6\u5316\u8840\u7ea2\u86cb\u767d\uff08HbA1c\uff09\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0e\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u5e76\u53d1\u75c7\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002 \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a \n\u9009\u53d62010\u5e74\u4e2d\u56fd\u6162\u6027\u75c5\u53ca\u5176\u5371\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u76d1\u6d4b11\u4e2a\u770160\u4e2a\u76d1\u6d4b\u70b9\u4e2d4 832\u540d2\u578b\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u4e8e2016-2017\u5e74\u8fdb\u884c\u968f\u8bbf\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u968f\u8bbf3 \n516\u540d\uff0c\u6392\u9664\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u5e38\u6216\u7f3a\u5931\u7b49\u60c5\u51b5\u540e\uff0c\u51713 \n427\u540d\u7eb3\u5165\u5206\u6790\u3002\u91c7\u7528Cox\u6bd4\u4f8b\u98ce\u9669\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30HbA1c\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0e\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u5e76\u53d1\u75c7\uff08\u5927\u8840\u7ba1\u75c5\u53d8\u3001\u5fae\u8840\u7ba1\u75c5\u53d8\u548c\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u8db3\uff09\u53d1\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5e76\u6309\u7167\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u6027\u522b\u3001\u5438\u70df\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u4e9a\u7ec4\u5206\u6790\u3002 \n\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a \u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u8c61\u51713 \n427\u540d\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u968f\u8bbf6.2\u5e74\uff0c\u968f\u8bbf\u671f\u95f4395\u540d\u53d1\u751f\u5927\u8840\u7ba1\u75c5\u53d8\uff0c226\u540d\u53d1\u751f\u5fae\u8840\u7ba1\u75c5\u53d8\uff0c57\u540d\u53d1\u751f\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u8db3\u3002\u8c03\u6574\u76f8\u5173\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\u540e\uff0c\u4ee5HbA1c<7.0%\u7ec4\u4e3a\u53c2\u7167\uff0cHbA1c\u6c34\u5e737.0%~\u30017.5%~\u30018.0%~8.4%\u7ec4\u5927\u8840\u7ba1\u75c5\u53d8\u53d1\u751f\u98ce\u9669\u672a\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u22658.5%\u7ec4\u5927\u8840\u7ba1\u75c5\u53d8\u53d1\u751f\u98ce\u9669\u589e\u52a038%\uff08HR=1.38\uff0c95%CI\uff1a1.06~1.80\uff09\uff1bHbA1c\u6c34\u5e737.5%~\u30018.0%~\u3001\u22658.5%\u7ec4\u5fae\u8840\u7ba1\u75c5\u53d8\u53d1\u751f\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u522b\u589e\u52a0131%\uff08HR=2.31\uff0c95%CI\uff1a1.46~3.65\uff09\u3001206%\uff08HR=3.06\uff0c95%CI\uff1a1.91~4.90\uff09\u548c208%\uff08HR=3.08\uff0c95%CI\uff1a2.20~4.30\uff09\uff1bHbA1c\u22658.5%\u7ec4\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u8db3\u53d1\u751f\u98ce\u9669\u589e\u52a0253%\uff08HR=3.53\uff0c95%CI\uff1a1.89~6.59\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u7ec4\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u8db3\u53d1\u751f\u98ce\u9669\u672a\u89c1\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u4e9a\u7ec4\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u60c5\u51b5\uff08\u65e2\u5f80\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u65b0\u8bca\u65ad\uff09\u5bf9HbA1c\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0e\u5fae\u8840\u7ba1\u75c5\u53d8\u53d1\u751f\u98ce\u9669\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u5e94\u4fee\u9970\u4f5c\u7528\u3002 \n\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a \nHbA1c\u22657.5%\u4f1a\u589e\u52a02\u578b\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u5fae\u8840\u7ba1\u75c5\u53d8\u7684\u53d1\u751f\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e14\u53d1\u751f\u98ce\u9669\u968fHbA1c\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u5347\u9ad8\u800c\u589e\u52a0\uff1bHbA1c\u22658.5%\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u5927\u8840\u7ba1\u75c5\u53d8\u548c\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u8db3\u7684\u53d1\u751f\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u5e94\u52a0\u5f3a\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u6559\u80b2\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8840\u7cd6\u7ba1\u7406\u610f\u8bc6\uff0c\u5c3d\u91cf\u5c06HbA1c\u63a7\u5236\u5728\u8f83\u4f4e\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u6216\u5ef6\u7f13\u5e76\u53d1\u75c7\u7684\u53d1\u751f\u3002.\n\nDOI: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20250127-00065\nPMID: 40677178 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n31.

By assuming a person would maintain \nhis or her eating habit over time, we extend the simulation period to several \nyears and explore scenarios based on food choices (high-fiber vs. \nhigh-carbohydrate) or appetite suppression. The model coherently predicts \nincrements or decrements in body weight in the long-term when altering appetite \nin the short-term. Further, the model shows how food type choice, at the same \nappetite drive and habitual proposed meal size, induces macroscopic changes in \nbody weight over a very few years. The model is innovative in that it connects \nthe minute-by-minute behavior of the individual with long-term changes in \nmetabolic compensation, in insulin sensitivity, in glycemic variability, and \neventually in body size, thus helping to interpret the long-term development of \nType 2 diabetes mellitus resulting from an unhealthy lifestyle.\n\nDOI: 10.3934/mbe.2025065\nPMID: 40676993 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n32.

As a result, there is a need for personalized T2D self-management \neducation and support that integrates mental health care. Despite the need for \nthis personalized care, existing systems remain siloed, hindering access and \nuptake. In response, innovative, comprehensive, and collaborative models of care \nhave been developed to address fragmentations in care. As individuals living \nwith T2D often receive their care in primary care settings, linking mental \nhealth care to existing teams and networks in primary care settings is required. \nHowever, there is a need to understand how best to support access, adoption, and \nengagement with these models in these unique contexts.\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional survey was distributed to primary and community \nproviders of an Ontario-based smoking cessation network. Survey data were \nanalyzed descriptively with free text responses thematically reported.\nFINDINGS: Survey respondents (n = 85) represented a broad mix of health \nprofessions across primary and community care settings. Addressing challenges to \nthe delivery and uptake of personalized T2D care requires comprehensive \nstrategies to address patient-, practice-, and system-level challenges. Findings \nfrom this survey identify the need to tailor these models of care to individual \nneeds, clearly addressing mental health needs, and building strong partnership \nas means of enhancing accessibility and sustainability of integrated care \ndelivery in primary care settings.\n\nDOI: 10.1017/S1463423625100236\nPMID: 40676959 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n33.

Weight loss has a favourable effect on the adipose tissue \nsecretome and prevents the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and \nits complications. The most effective methods of glycaemic control are bariatric \nsurgery (BS) and pharmacotherapy. The aim of our study is to evaluate changes in \nadipose tissue secretome after BS and semaglutide injections.\nMETHODS: 17 patients with T2DM were examined before and 6 months after BS or \nsemaglutide therapy. The examination protocol included anthropometry, clinical \nbiochemistry, insulin resistance evaluation and collection of subcutaneous \nadipose tissue biopsies. Adipose derived stem cells (ADSC) were isolated from \nbiopsies according to a standard enzymatic protocol and differentiated into \nwhite and beige adipocytes. Adipogenesis and thermogenesis were assessed by \nconfocal microscopy. Secretome of adipocytes and cytokines plasma levels were \nanalyzed using a MILLIPLEX panel.\nRESULTS: Following BS and semaglutide therapy, a decline in BMI, total fat \ncontent, HbA1c, and fasting blood glucose was observed. Insulin sensitivity \nincreased only 6 months after BS. Semaglutide therapy resulted in the elevation \nof angiogenic and proinflammatory cytokines in adipocyte secretory profile. \nAfter BS we also detected the increase in proinflammatory cytokines both in \nadipocyte secretome and in plasma levels. However, the adipocyte secretome \nsubsequent to bariatric surgery (BS) exhibited a reduced proinflammatory \nresponse in comparison to that observed following semaglutide therapy.\nCONCLUSIONS: The effect of semaglutide injections directly on adipose tissue can \nchange the function of ADSC, making them more angiogenic and adipogenic. A \ndecrease in BMI, HbA1c and insulin resistance is achieved to a significant \nextent only after BS. BS-induced T2DM remission is related to lower \npro-inflammatory secretion from adipocytes as compared to semaglutide. The \nregulation of inflammation in adipocytes may serve as a potential mechanism \nunderlying BS-induced T2DM remission.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Only diagnosis \ncodes were used to identify patients with CKD, with laboratory measurements of \nestimated-glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria unavailable. Utilisation of \nsodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and renin-angiotensin system \n[RAS] inhibitors were evaluated in new users following the first Norwegian \napproval of an SGLT-2 inhibitor for CKD treatment.\nRESULTS: Approximately 3% (125,163 patients) of adults in Norway had diagnosed \nCKD (average age 70 years, 42% women, 73% without T2D). When describing patients \nwith or without T2D, history of heart failure (22% versus 22%), atherosclerotic \ncardiovascular disease (ASCVD; 57% versus 51%), and atrial fibrillation (24% \nversus 27%) were similar. Larger proportions of those with T2D received SGLT-2 \ninhibitors (24% versus 4%) and/or RAS inhibitors (63% versus 47%). \nHospitalisations for CKD (28.1 versus 22.1 events per 100 patient years), heart \nfailure (12.6 versus 9.8), myocardial infarction (3.9 versus 2.2), and stroke \n(3.2 versus 2.3) were more common in patients with CKD and T2D than those \nwithout T2D. However, mortality (10.8 versus 8.5) was higher in patients without \nT2D. CKD and heart failure costs were higher than those for ASCVD, and generally \nhigher in patients with T2D. SGLT-2 inhibitor utilisation increased two-fold the \nyear after its approval but was still low, used mostly at its highest target \ndose. Discontinuation rates were lower with SGLT-2 inhibitors than with RAS \ninhibitors, the latter mostly utilised at low doses.\nCONCLUSIONS: A CKD diagnosis was associated with substantial morbidity and \nmortality, costs, and undertreatment, both in patients with and without T2D. Use \nof novel kidney-protective treatment has increased, but an urgent need to \nimprove the utilisation of kidney-protective medications remains, particularly \nin patients without T2D.\nCLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Iodine is an essential molecule that is used to \nproduce the classical thyroid hormones that contribute to growth and development \nof various parts of the body and play a significant role as metabolic \nregulators. The cloning of the human NIS gene in 1996 has led to widespread \nadvancements in thyroid-related research. Amongst these, the significant \ndiscovery of extra-thyroidal expression of thyroid-specific genes and proteins \nsuch as NIS in both human and non-human subjects has been well documented. The \nidentification of NIS protein in non-thyroid tissue provides potential targets \nfor therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating autoimmune responses in \nvarious parts of the body. In the diagnosis and prognosis of different types of \ncancer, the molecular and protein expression of NIS may prove to be an important \ncancer biomarker. This review will cover the extra-thyroidal distribution of \nNIS, as well as its pathophysiological implications in various tissues of human \nand non-human organs.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Gadisi, Naicker and Naidoo.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fendo.2025.1567405\nPMCID: PMC12267006\nPMID: 40678322 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n36.

Following up to 3 years \nold, only one child (1/81, 1.2%) exhibited development delay in personal-social \ndevelopment. Neonates with transient hyperthyrotropinaemia scored higher in \nproblem-solving and personal-social domains than those with persistent \nhyperthyrotropinaemia. Neonatal FT4 at 7-14 days, timing of TSH normalization, \nand maternal early-pregnancy FT4 influenced the neurodevelopment of neonates. \nInfants of mothers with gestational diabetes scored lower in the personal-social \ndomain.\nCONCLUSIONS: Persistent hyperthyrotropinemia occurs in 5.7% of mild cases and is \nassociated with higher initial TSH. Levothyroxine at 3-5 \u00b5g/kg/day is both \nadequate and safe. The majority of neonates got a normal neurodevelopment by age \n3, and the subtle difference between transient and persistent \nhyperthyrotropinemia was impacted by both maternal and neonatal factors.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Sun, Zhang, Zhang, Zhou, Tang, Liu and Hou.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fendo.2025.1548086\nPMCID: PMC12267032\nPMID: 40678318 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n37.

According to the thyroid status after receiving \nPD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors treatment, patients were divided into normal thyroid group \nand thyroid irAEs group. The clinical characteristics, including age, gender, \ntumor type, previous anti-cancer treatment history and thyroid function status \nwere evaluated. After the occurrence of thyroid irAEs, thyroid function \nevaluation, onset time, and survival outcomes were analyzed. Risk factors that \nmay contribute to the thyroid irAEs were further explored by logistic \nregression.\nRESULTS: Out of 1151 patients treated with a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor, 257 (22.3%) \ndeveloped new thyroid irAEs, with the vast majority (98.0%) being hypothyroidism \n(193/257, 75.1%) and Grade1-2 (252/257, 98.0%), including 252 Hashimoto's \nthyroiditis (98.0%), 3 subacute thyroiditis (1.17%) and 2 Graves' disease \n(0.78%). There was a significant difference in the number of treatment cycles of \nPD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors between the two groups (P\u2009=\u20090.001). In multivariate \nanalysis, gastrointestinal cancer, radiotherapy history, targeted therapy \nhistory, positive TgAb and TPOAb at baseline were associated with thyroid irAEs \ncaused by PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Absence of thyroid irAEs predicted increased \nmortality overall (HR\u2009=\u20092.935, P\u2009=\u20090.024) and particularly in gastrointestinal \ncancers (HR\u2009=\u20099.453, P\u2009=\u20090.007), despite comparable crude mortality (5.84% vs. \n5.82%, P\u2009=\u20090.228). No association was observed in lung/other tumors. Thyroid \nfunction recovery occurred in 36.2% of patients, and treatment interruption due \nto thyroid irAEs was rare (3.5%).\nCONCLUSION: In our group, 22.3% patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors \ndeveloped thyroid irAEs. The main subtype of thyroid irAEs was hypothyroidism \n(75.1%). Patients with gastrointestinal cancer, previous radiotherapy, history \nof targeted therapy, and baseline TgAb or TPOAb positivity may increase the risk \nof thyroid irAEs. Thyroid irAEs was associated with a trend for a survival \nbenefit in patients with gastrointestinal cancer.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Thyroid hormones, with skin receptors, impact \nimmune functions and epidermal inflammation. We hypothesised that skin features \nlike xerosis and papular lesions, common in demodicosis, may also appear in \nautoimmune thyroid diseases, with immune dysregulation increasing Demodex \ncolonisation. We recruited 201 patients with demodicosis or rosacea at Kayseri \nCity Education and Research Hospital. Thyroid hormones (TSH, T3, and T4), \nanti-TPO antibodies, and demodex count measured by Standard Superficial Skin \nBiopsy were assessed. Patients were classified as Type 1 (erythema, \ntelangiectasia, and rough skin) or Type 2 (papules and pustules) demodicosis. \nResults revealed that patients with elevated anti-TPO levels had significantly \nhigher demodex counts (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Demodex positivity and anti-TPO levels were \nstrongly associated with Type 2 demodicosis (p\u2009<\u20090.001, p\u2009=\u20090.008). There was a \npositive correlation between demodex count and anti-TPO (r\u2009=\u20090.144, p\u2009=\u20090.043), \nwith a predictive value for anti-TPO positivity (p\u2009=\u20090.004). Our findings \nsuggest that increased demodex counts in Type 2 demodicosis correlate with \nautoimmune thyroid disease risk, highlighting the potential of combined Demodex \ncount and thyroid antibody assessments for early diagnosis.\n\n\u00a9 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\n\nDOI: 10.1111/pim.70016\nPMID: 40659514 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n39.

Micronutrients act as cofactors in DNA replication, \nrepair, and antioxidant defence, while environmental exposure, such as \nradiation, heavy metals, and endocrine-disrupting chemicals, can directly damage \nDNA, leading to genomic instability. Although many studies have confirmed the \nlink between micronutrient status and thyroid health, the effects of nutrient \nimbalances and environmental stressors on thyroid DNA remain underexplored. This \nnarrative review examines how these factors may compromise thyroid genome \nstability and contribute to disease development. The analysis focused on the \nroles of iodine, selenium, iron, zinc, copper and vitamins D, B9, and B12 as \nwell as environmental exposures such as radiation, heavy metals, and \nendocrine-disrupting chemicals. The findings suggest that both micronutrient \nimbalance and environmental stress can impair DNA integrity in thyroid cells. \nUnderstanding these complex relationships is critical for developing effective \nstrategies to maintain thyroid health and mitigate the risk of thyroid diseases \nassociated with compromised genomic integrity. Methodology: This narrative \nreview was based on 254 articles retrieved through a manual search of the PubMed \nand Google Scholar databases, covering the years 2000-2025 and focusing on the \ninfluence of micronutrients and environmental factors on thyroid DNA integrity \nand repair. Several seminal earlier publications, fundamental to a comprehensive \nunderstanding of the topic, were also included.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/nu17132065\nPMCID: PMC12251246\nPMID: 40647171 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflicts of interest.\n\n\n40.

From \nthe 2007 to 2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), \n6,963 adults aged 18 years and above were included in this cross-sectional \nstudy. Serum MHR levels and thyroid function indicators were extracted from \nlaboratory data. Weighted multivariate linear regression models, subgroup \nanalyses, interaction tests, smoothed curve fitting, and threshold effects were \nused to investigate the associations of the MHR with thyroid function. In the \ncomplete adjusted model, lnMHR was positively correlated with FT3 (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.10, 95% \nCI 0.07, 0.12), TT3 (\u03b2\u2009=\u20093.33, 95% CI 2.01, 4.65), and TT4(\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.20, 95% CI \n0.11, 0.29) and negatively correlated with TPOAb (p\u2009=\u20090.019 for trend) after \ncategorizing lnMHR into quartiles. We observed a J-shaped curve between lnMHR \nand FT3 and TT4 using a smoothed curve fitting. The subgroup analysis suggested \nthe relationship between lnMHR and various thyroid function indicators was \ninfluenced by age, body mass index (BMI), urinary iodine concentration (UIC), \nhypertension. The findings of this study suggest that MHR is closely related to \nthyroid functions. Further research is required to confirm this association.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

There are \ncurrently few studies utilizing multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging \n(MRI) to investigate diffuse thyroid lesions such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis. \nThis study aims to explore the value of multi-parametric MRI in assessing the \nprogression of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study \nultimately included 40 patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, who were randomly \nand evenly assigned to an intervention group and a control group. The \nintervention group received dietary management, while the control group received \nno intervention. Laboratory and imaging tests were conducted at baseline and 6 \nmonths later. RESULTS After dietary management, patients with Hashimoto's \nthyroiditis showed a significant reduction in thyroid T2-weighted imaging \nrelative signal intensity (T2WI RSI) (mean: 1.69\u00b10.35 vs 1.42\u00b10.24, P<0.05) and \nwater fraction (mean: 94.57\u00b11.76 vs 93.36\u00b11.62, P<0.001). Additionally, thyroid \nperoxidase antibody (TPOAb) and thyroglobulin antibody (TGAb) levels decreased \nsignificantly (TPOAb: 376.58\u00b1319.52 vs 273.55\u00b1287.63, P<0.05; TGAb: \n219.06\u00b1572.54 vs 198.80\u00b1567.59, P<0.05). In contrast, no significant changes in \nthyroid water fraction, TPOAb, or TGAb levels were observed in the control group \n(P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, multi-parametric MRI offers a valuable \nquantitative tool for assessing Hashimoto's thyroiditis, providing an intuitive \nand sensitive method to improve disease understanding and management.\n\nDOI: 10.12659/MSM.947862\nPMCID: PMC12261963\nPMID: 40638545 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Conflict of interest: None declared\n\n\n43.

The purpose of this study is to illuminate \nthe correlation between thyroid hormone sensitivity and Lp(a) in euthyroid \npatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).\nMETHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 1097 patients with T2DM. The \nthyroid hormone sensitivity indices, the thyroid feedback quantile-based index \n(TFQI), the thyroid-stimulating hormone index (TSHI), the thyrotrophic T4 \nresistance index (TT4RI), and the free triiodothyronine(FT3)/free thyroxine \n(FT4) ratio were calculated. Linear and binary logistic regression analysis were \nperformed to assess the relationship between thyroid hormone sensitivity indices \nand Lp(a). Restricted cubic splines were also used to evaluate the association \nbetween thyroid hormone sensitivity indices and Lp(a).\nRESULT: Among the 1097 participants, the percentage of Lp(a)\u226530 mg/dL was 20.3%. \nLinear regression analysis revealed that TFQI displayed a positive correlation \nwith Lp(a) levels, whereas the FT3/FT4 ratio exhibited a negative correlation. \nThe adjusted odds ratio (aOR)(95% confidence interval(CI)) for high Lp(a) level \nwas increased with rising TFQI quartiles(Q3: aOR 1.49,95% CI 1.09-2.06; Q4: aOR \n1.74, 95% CI 1.36-2.23) (P<0.05),with Q1 as the reference. By contrast,the \naOR(95% CI) for high Lp(a) level was decreased with rising FT3/FT4 ratio \nquartiles (P<0.05). The robustness of these findings was further confirmed by \nrestricted cubic spline analysis.\nCONCLUSION: In euthyroid T2DM patients, decreased sensitivity to thyroid \nhormones was found to be linked with high Lp(a) level. Screening for thyroid \nhormone insensitivity and serum Lp(a) levels should be emphasized in euthyroid \nT2DM patients for early intervention and improved outcomes.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Zhong, Lin, Cao, Zhong, Tu and Wei.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fendo.2025.1591108\nPMCID: PMC12238823\nPMID: 40636715 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n44.

Methods: We conducted a \ncross-sectional study among 357 participants with euthyroid T2DM. Plasma BCAAs \nand BCKAs were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), while \nfour thyroid function parameters, including triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine \n(T4), free triiodothyronine (FT3), and free thyroxine (FT4), were determined by \nan automatic biochemical analyzer. The variance inflation factor (VIF) was used \nto investigate variable collinearity. Pearson correlation and multivariate \nlinear regression analysis were used to establish the relationship between BCAAs \nor BCKAs and thyroid function parameters. Results: The means of T3, T4, FT3, and \nFT4 were different among the three groups divided by BCAA tertiles (all p < \n0.05), and the means of T3 and FT3 were different among the three groups divided \nby BCKA tertiles (all p < 0.01). Pearson correlation analysis indicated a \npositive relationship between all the thyroid function parameters and BCAA \nlevels (p < 0.05), while a statistically significant inverse relationship was \nestablished between T3 and FT3 levels and BCKA levels (p < 0.01). Collinearity \nanalysis demonstrated no collinearity among the variables (tolerance: \n0.501~0.922; VIF: 1.084~1.995). Multivariate linear regression analysis showed \nthat thyroid function parameters were significantly associated with BCAAs \n(coefficients: 0.042 to 4.614, p < 0.05) and BCKAs (coefficients: -0.200 to \n-0.156, p < 0.01) after adjusting for other potential confounding factors. \nConclusions: Thyroid function parameters positively correlated with plasma BCAAs \nbut negatively correlated with plasma BCKAs in patients with euthyroid T2DM. \nHowever, further prospective studies are needed to explore potential causal \nrelationships and verify these findings.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Xinghua Cai et al.

The spontaneous mutation resulted from insertion of a L1 long \ninterspersed nuclear element (LINE-1) into an intron within the Thyroglobulin \n(Tg) gene. The mouse genome contains a significant amount of retrotransposon \nDNA, and these mobile genetic elements routinely change genomic location through \nretrotransposition, including in germ cells. Analysis of the thyroid \ntranscriptome suggested that the presence of the LINE-1 interferes with the Tg \ngene splicing, resulting in exclusion of exon 26 from most Tg transcripts in \nanimals homozygous (HOM) for the insertion. The LINE-1 insertion allele of the \nTg gene has been designated Tgtdys-Tac. The resulting phenotype is inherited in \nan autosomal dominant manner with affected mice exhibiting thyroid follicular \ncell dysplasia that progresses to thyroid adenoma by 9 months of age with \ncomplete penetrance in homozygotes. Serum thyroid hormone measurements revealed \na decrease in triiodothyronine (T3) levels in homozygotes at 12 months of age, \nas well as a decrease in tetraiodothyronine (T4) levels at 6-9 months and at 12 \nmonths of age in both heterozygotes and homozygotes. In addition, serum Thyroid \nStimulating Hormone (TSH) level was strongly increased in homozygotes at 6-8 \nmonths of age, consistent with hypothyroidism. Computational molecular modeling \nshowed that omission of the 64 amino acids from the TG protein arm domain, which \nis the consequence of exon 26-skipping in the Tg transcript, results in \ndecreased local stability. This result in combination with the observed \nup-regulation in unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways in the thyroids of \naffected animals, identifies the arm domain of TG as important for its proper \ncellular distribution. This report describes a spontaneous retrotransposon \ninsertion causatively linked to dysregulated physiological phenotypes in a \nwidely used inbred mouse strain.\n\nCopyright: \u00a9 2025 Bailey et al.

A \ncross-sectional analysis was conducted on 136 radiology and radiation-related \nemployees. Thyroid status, assessed via ultrasonography and serum T3, T4, and \nTSH measurements, was compared with complete blood counts (CBC). While no \nsignificant gender-based differences in thyroid hormones or structure were \nobserved, TSH levels correlated significantly with occupational group (P=0.016), \nand T3 levels correlated with working hours (P=0.03). Radiologists exhibited \nhigher RDW-CV compared to radiographers and other staff (P=0.009). Significant \ngender differences were noted in lymphocyte counts, hemoglobin, red blood cells, \nand hematocrit. In males, WBC and MCHC fluctuated significantly with increased \nworking hours. These findings suggest that chronic, low-dose X-ray exposure may \ninfluence thyroid hormone regulation and hematopoiesis in radiology \nprofessionals. Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying \ncellular and molecular mechanisms and to refine radiation safety protocols.\n\nDOI: 10.14715/cmb/2025.71.6.2\nPMID: 40618340 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"}
