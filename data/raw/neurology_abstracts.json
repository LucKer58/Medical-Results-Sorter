A quantitative research design \nwas employed, and participants were randomly divided into an experimental group \nand a control group. The experimental group (51 participants) utilized a novel \nteaching model that integrated micro-learning, bedside teaching, and CBL, while \nthe control group (52 participants) employed Lecture-Based Learning (LBL) \nmethods. The study focused on several indicators, including theoretical \nassessment scores from standardized training, student satisfaction and interest \nin the teaching content, clinical competency evaluations, and self-assessments \nby instructors.\nRESULTS: The novel teaching model combining micro-learning, bedside teaching, \nand CBL significantly outperformed traditional teaching methods in improving \nresidents' theoretical assessment scores (83.02\u2009\u00b1\u20097.33 vs. 76.04\u2009\u00b1\u20097.19) and \nclinical competency evaluations, particularly in comprehensive ability \nassessments (85.55\u2009\u00b1\u20095.24 vs. 75.10\u2009\u00b1\u20097.86). Students also reported a marked \nincrease in satisfaction with the teaching content and learning interest \n(P\u2009<\u20090.01). Furthermore, instructors expressed a high level of recognition for \nthe new course model in their post-class self-evaluations (P\u2009<\u20090.01).\nCONCLUSION: The findings of this study indicate that the integration of \nmicro-learning, bedside teaching, and CBL can provide a more effective teaching \nmodel for the training of neurology residents, offering strong support for \nfuture reforms and developments in medical education.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Simulator classes should be part of continuing \nmedical education, generating advances that make it necessary for technical \ndevelopment and specialization in complex, complicated, or \ndifficult-to-reproduce scenarios that students may face, based on clinical \nproblems with negative feedback, allowing for learning from mistakes. The \nobjective of the review is to identify the usefulness of simulation in teaching \nthe new medicine.\nMETHODS: Using the PRISMA 2020 declaration, articles published in the last 5 \nyears on simulation teaching in neurology were reviewed. These articles were \nsourced from databases such as PubMed, Mendeley, Wiley, Web of Science, \nCochrane, Latindex, and Google Scholar. In the summary of results, only those \nstudies that met the inclusion criteria were selected for analysis.\nRESULTS: Twenty-six randomized clinical trials on medical education and training \nwere selected. The analysis showed that simulation improved skill scores to \nsupport simulation-based medical diagnosis and treatment.\nCONCLUSION: Simulation-based education has demonstrated statistical benefits in \nlearning, skill acquisition, feedback, and stress reduction, particularly in the \nspecialties of ophthalmology, emergency medicine, neurology, neurosurgery, \nneuroanatomy, and neuropathology, providing great relevance to the present \nreview. No study reported beneficial effects or effects on mortality: despite \nimproved surgical skill times among participants, no statistically significant \ndata were found on a reduction in operative complications. Simulation \ntechnologies such as artificial intelligence, mixed reality, and robotics are \nunder development, the impact of which on improving the quality of care is still \nunknown.\nCLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

For certain entities, this histomolecular \ndiagnosis now includes DNA methylation profiles. Methylation profiles reflect \nthe cell of origin and epigenetic modifications that occur during tumorigenesis \nand may help classify central nervous system tumors via artificial intelligence \nalgorithms. This powerful approach to tumor classification has revolutionized \nthe field of neuro-oncology, allowing more reliable diagnosis and prognostic \nassessment, particularly for pediatric neoplasms. The analysis of methylation \nprofiles currently requires data to be shared with the developer of the AI \nalgorithms.

This \nstudy aimed to assess the impact of a brief interactive IPL workshop on \ninterprofessional identity among medical students.\nMETHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, neurology clerkship students \n(N\u2009=\u200939) were allocated to either a 90-min interactive IPL workshop or a \nnon-interactive control session. We assessed outcomes by triangulating findings \nacross Extended Professional Identity Scale (EPIS-G) scores, challenges and \nopportunities perceived by students, and reflective responses on \ninterprofessional identity and applicability.\nRESULTS: On a group level, The IPL intervention group (n\u2009=\u200927) demonstrated \nimprovements in all domains of interprofessional identity on the EPIS-G (paired \nsamples t-test, p\u2009<\u20090.001) which was not observed in the control group (n\u2009=\u200910). \nCommunication challenges and resource limitations were primary concerns among \nstudents, while information sharing and enhanced patient care emerged as key \nopportunities. Qualitative analysis highlighted students' increased commitment \nto collaboration, openness to teamwork, and recognition of the patient care \nbenefits inherent in collaborative practices.\nCONCLUSIONS: An interactive 90-min IPL workshop within a neurology clerkship can \ninitiate medical students' interprofessional identity formation. Students' \ninsights into relevant challenges and opportunities indicate their basic \nunderstanding of the complexity of collaborative practice. This study supports \nthe future integration of IPL specifically within neurology to advance \ncollaborative practice.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Placental pathology has been implicated as a likely cause of injury \nto the developing central nervous system (CNS). This study aims to elucidate the \nassociations of multiple placental pathologies and CNS injury, including more \nsubtle brain pathologies associated with adverse neurologic outcomes. Sixty-five \nsubjects that underwent complete post-mortem neuropathologic examination and \nplacental examination were selected for inclusion. Gross images, autopsy \nreports, and histologic sections from the CNS and placenta underwent blinded \nreviewed by experts in perinatal neuropathology and placental pathology, \nrespectively. Immunostains useful in highlighting CNS lesions not apparent on \nroutine histologic sections were performed. Placental pathology was classified \naccording to the Amsterdam criteria, and all placental and CNS abnormalities \nwere documented. A previously undescribed association between white matter \ninjury and fetal vascular malperfusion was seen, likely due to improved \ndetection of injury on immunohistochemical stains. Amniotic fluid infection was \nassociated with acute neuronal injury in the cortex and cerebellum as well as \nsubarachnoid hemorrhage. Hippocampal injury had the strongest association with \nhigh-grade chronic inflammation, and maternal vascular malperfusion showed \nhigher relative frequencies of acute neuronal injury in the basal ganglia, \nbrainstem, and spinal cord. To our knowledge, this is the first study to \nstandardize placental pathology according to the Amsterdam consensus criteria, \nseparate out injury across multiple CNS regions with independent assessment of \nthese regions, and to utilize immunohistochemistry to improve detection of white \nmatter injury. Different patterns of placental pathology were associated with \ndifferent types of CNS injury, indicating neuronal injury and white matter \ninjury may be influenced by distinct placental pathologies. Elucidating the \nplacental contributions to these acquired CNS pathologies in stillborns is \ncrucial for understanding long-term adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes \nassociated with perinatal brain injury.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

To address these challenges, the European Academy of Neurology \n(EAN), in collaboration with the European Federation of Autonomic Societies \n(EFAS) and the International Neuro-Urology Society (INUS), developed the \nNEUROGED guidelines. These guidelines aim to provide neurologists with \nevidence-based recommendations for managing neurogenic bladder and sexual \ndysfunctions. The task force comprised 37 members from 17 countries across four \ncontinents, highlighting a comprehensive and collaborative effort. The committee \nhas established evidence-based recommendations for 11 key questions, \nconsensus-based recommendations for eight questions, and good practice \nstatements for 19, addressing the complexities of managing neurogenic urogenital \ndysfunction. This review seeks to enhance understanding of the NEUROGED \nguidelines through two sections. The first section examines the neuroanatomy, \npathophysiology, and clinical presentation of lower urinary tract symptoms \n(LUTS) and sexual dysfunction (SD), establishing a basis for the guidelines. The \nsecond section explores the impact of the NEUROGED guidelines on the \ninvestigation and management of urogenital symptoms, addressing their \nimplementation and potential barriers in clinical practice.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Elsevier B.V.

While \nneurology teaching initiatives and training programs are growing in the region, \ninnovative teaching methods are needed to improve neurology knowledge, reduce \nneurophobia, and encourage medical students to pursue careers in neurology. \nFurthermore, studies formally evaluating the effectiveness of different \nneurology teaching methods are needed.\nMETHODS: Fifth and seventh year undergraduate medical students on their internal \nmedicine clinical clerkship were randomized by clerkship group (i.e. all \nstudents completing the clerkship in a given time period were randomized \ntogether) to either a traditional lecture or flipped classroom curriculum for \ndelivery of the neurology content of their clerkship. In the traditional \nclassroom arm, students attended in-person neurology lectures and accessed \ncorresponding clinical case presentations online. In the flipped classroom arm, \nstudents watched pre-recorded neurology lectures, and class time was dedicated \nto interactive small group review of clinical cases. Students completed \nanonymous pre- and post-course surveys consisting of knowledge assessments, \nself-reported confidence in diagnosing/managing neurologic disorders, \nneurophobia surveys, and course satisfaction surveys. Pre-and post- course score \ndifferences and differences in change scores were compared between instructional \nmodels along with quantified effect sizes.\nRESULTS: In total, 263 fifth year students (100 traditional, 163 flipped) and 99 \nseventh year students (48 traditional, 51 flipped) had complete data and were \nincluded in final analysis. A greater increase in knowledge assessment scores \nwas observed in both the fifth and seventh year flipped classroom groups \ncompared to the traditional groups (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01 for both). Both fifth and seventh \nyear students in the flipped classroom groups also demonstrated a greater \nincrease in confidence diagnosing and managing common neurologic conditions \ncompared to students in the traditional groups. Flipped classroom students in \nboth year groups reported significantly greater course satisfaction, effective \nlearning, course participation, and course collaboration. Neurophobia scores \nsignificantly decreased only in the fifth year flipped classroom group.\nCONCLUSIONS: A flipped classroom approach improved neurology knowledge, \nconfidence diagnosing/managing neurologic disorders, and course satisfaction in \nZambian medical students compared to traditional lectures. The flipped classroom \napproach may represent a promising pedagogical model for improving neurology \neducation in similar resource-limited settings with few neurologists.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

Data were retrieved from the Web of Science database, \nencompassing 5,020 publications focusing on AI in clinical neurology and \nneuroimaging. Among these, 2,687 were original research articles, predominantly \npublished in English, with an average of 19.44 citations per article and an \nH-index of 90. Our analysis reveals a significant increase in publication \nactivity, particularly after 2019, with the annual count peaking at 607 articles \nin 2024. The United States and China emerged as the leading contributors, and a \nstrong positive correlation was found between publication productivity and both \ngross domestic product (GDP) and GDP purchasing power parity. However, no \nsignificant relationship was observed with the Human Development Index. Key \nresearch areas include radiology, psychiatry, and surgery, with machine learning \nand deep learning dominating the field. Regression models predict continued \ngrowth in AI-related research, underscoring its expanding role in advancing \ndiagnostic and therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders. This study \nhighlights the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and high-impact \njournals in shaping the future of AI applications in clinical neurology and \nneuroimaging.\n\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2025.

Tirzepatide treatment significantly \ninhibited glioma cell proliferation and migration, as demonstrated by the CCK-8 \nand Transwell migration assays. Tirzepatide also induced lipid peroxidation, \nevidenced by increased ROS levels, elevated MDA production, and reduced SOD \nactivity, while the GSH/GSSG ratio was decreased, reflecting oxidative stress. \nFerroptosis was further confirmed by increased Fe2+ concentrations and \nalterations in iron metabolism-related genes (Ferritin and TFR1) and lipid \nmetabolism-related genes (ACSL4 and GPX4). Tirzepatide also inhibited the \nSOX2/SLC7A11 axis, which plays a critical role in resisting ferroptosis.

Employing a national \ndatabase, we examined the pre- and postoperative incidences of epilepsy/seizures \nand risk factors associated with postoperative epilepsy/seizures in patients \nreadmitted within 30 days and/or 90 days following meningioma resection. \nMethods: The 2010-2014 Nationwide Readmissions Database was analyzed. \nConsecutive patients undergoing surgery for meningioma resection were identified \nusing appropriate ICD-9-CM codes. Standard descriptive techniques and \nmultivariate regression were used to identify predictors of postoperative \nepilepsy/seizure after discharge. Results: Among 46,107 patients undergoing \nmeningioma resection at index hospitalization, 20.40% (n = 9408) had \npreoperative epilepsy/seizure diagnosis. The mean patient age was 58.37 \u00b1 \n13.85\u2009years. Patients with preoperative epilepsy/seizures were more likely to be \nmale (p < 0.001), frail (p < 0.001), and with higher comorbidity index scores (p \n< 0.001). The overall readmission rate was 30.36% and was higher among patients \nwith preoperative epilepsy/seizures (36.66% vs. 28.75%, p < 0.001). \nRespectively, 30- and 90-day readmission rates were higher among patients \n(13.22% vs. 11.73%, p < 0.001) and (23.25% vs 20.30%, p = 0.04) with \nepilepsy/seizure diagnosis at index admission. Predictors of postoperative \nepilepsy/seizures at 30- and 90-day readmissions included the preoperative \nepilepsy/seizure, malignant meningioma, peritumoral cerebral edema, and higher \ncomorbidity index scores, while male sex was significant only at 30-day \nreadmissions. Intraoperative electrocorticography was associated with a \ndecreased likelihood of postoperative epilepsy/seizures. Conclusion: Development \nof epilepsy/seizures after meningioma resection is likely multifactorial. \nIdentifying factors associated with postoperative epilepsy/seizures after \ndischarge is important in triaging and closer monitoring of at-risk patients and \nfor adapting management to help improve outcomes.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Rasha Elbadry et al.

This study is aimed at investigating the association between \nACTB and TLE. Trio-based exome sequencing was performed in a patient, and a de \nnovo ACTB variant was identified. The patient presented with TLE featuring by \nage of onset in juvenile, seizure-free status in adulthood, complications of \nmemory decline and irritability, epileptic discharges in the bilateral temporal \nlobes, and bilateral hippocampal sclerosis. The pathogenicity of the identified \nACTB variant was supposed by multiple pieces of evidence, including the missense \ntolerance ratio of 0%, high conservation of the affected residue, predicted to \nbe \"damaging\" or \"conserved\" by 17 in silico tools, and classification of likely \npathogenic variant by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics \n(ACMG) guidelines. Protein modeling indicated the alteration of protein \nstructure and stability caused by the identified variant. The spatiotemporal \nexpression of ACTB is consistent with the phenotypic features of this patient. \nThis study suggested that ACTB is a novel candidate causative gene of TLE. The \ncorrelation between phenotypes and spatial-temporal expression provides a novel \nperspective for further exploration of the pathogenesis and prognosis of the \ndisease.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Hong-Jun Yan et al.

In these regards, people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) \nor predisposed to develop MS - an autoimmune disorder of the Central Nervous \nSystem (CNS) - appear as a more vulnerable cohort to the effects of particulate \nmatter (PM) exposure.

To this purpose, we characterized plasmatic \nextracellular vesicles (EVs) and their microRNA (miRNA) cargo in healthy and \npresymptomatic EAE mice early after exposure to PM10, compared to unexposed \nhealthy and EAE mice. Results showed that the response of EAE mice to PM10 did \nnot differ in terms of EV number or source, compared to that of healthy mice. \nYet, remarkable differences existed in the identity of deregulated EV-associated \nmiRNAs, which, in EAE mice, were predicted to target several MS-relevant \nbiological processes and nervous system-, immune- and inflammation-related \npathways, possibly contributing to disease worsening.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Bonato, Cerrato, Dioni, Montarolo, Parolisi, Bertolotto, \nBollati, Ferrari and Boda.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1596935\nPMCID: PMC12267195\nPMID: 40677715 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.

It is usually localized in the \ncerebellum, leading to diffusion of tumor cells through the cerebrospinal fluid \nand metastases to other portions of the brain and spinal cord. Conventional \ntreatment consists of surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiation and/or \nchemotherapy. The side effects of these therapies are critical to consider, \nespecially given that patients are in a distinct stage of their lives. In \naddition, the overall survival is not satisfactory ranging from 50-90% depending \non the type of medulloblastoma. The molecular characterization has broadly \nsubdivided medulloblastoma into four subgroups, and more recently, the \nsingle-cell transcriptomics studies have further identified several other \nsubgroups. Important advances have been reported on the cell origin, their \nplasticity, heterogeneity of genetic and epigenetic alteration, and interaction \nwith the immune and stromal components of the tumor microenvironment. Research \nstudies on these key points are essential to make advances in planning the \napplication of conventional therapies together with immunotherapies. Herein, we \ndiscuss the main advances recently obtained on medulloblastoma biology and \nimmunotherapies. Overall, the biological and molecular features of \nmedulloblastoma are briefly summarized to understand the reason for the \napplication of the old and new immunotherapies. Immunotherapies considered \ninclude the identification of potential medulloblastoma neoantigens and \ntumor-associated antigens to generate antigen-specific T lymphocytes. The main \nantigens expressed by medulloblastoma cells and/or by components of the tumor \nmicroenvironment will be considered as the molecular targets of antibodies, \nantibody derivatives, and chimeric antigen receptor effector cells to improve \nthe conventional therapies. In the last portion of this review, the brief \nanalysis of the activating and inhibiting receptors expressed by antitumor T, \nnatural killer, and unconventional T cells can give new insights into the \npotential treatment of medulloblastoma.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Poggi, Reggiani, Azevedo, Raffaghello and Pereira.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1602930\nPMCID: PMC12267187\nPMID: 40677711 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.

The \nrecently identified iatrogenic CAA subtype (iCAA) is thought to be transmitted \nthrough medical procedures involving cadaveric human material and potentially \nneurosurgical instruments or blood transfusions. This raises ethical questions \nconcerning disclosure of iCAA. We consider ethical arguments concerning three \ndisclosure-related questions. Should clinicians disclose their suspicion of iCAA \nto patients presenting with CAA and a history of relevant exposure? Should \nclinicians recommend the additional tests needed for iCAA diagnosis? Should \nclinicians proactively identify and notify asymptomatic at-risk individuals who \nare unaware of their risk? We conclude that disclosure of the iCAA-diagnosis and \ncommunication of diagnostic uncertainties are warranted, based on professional \nresponsibility to facilitate autonomous decision-making, despite limited \nclinical benefits. While certain diagnoses are impossible, recommending \nadditional diagnostics can provide diagnostic support and exclude other causes. \nNotification of known exposure-confirmed, asymptomatic, at-risk individuals \nseems warranted; however, proactive identification remains challenging. \nHIGHLIGHTS: iCAA may result from A\u00df transmission via medical treatments. We \ndiscuss three clinically relevant disclosure-related ethical questions that \narise due to the uncertainty surrounding the discovery of iCAA. We focus on \ndisclosing to patients with suspected iCAA the recommendation of additional \ndiagnostics and proactive identification and notification of asymptomatic \npersons at risk. This analysis supports clinicians in their decision to disclose \na presumed iCAA diagnosis and when informing patients about additional CAA \ndiagnostics. Our findings serve as a reference tool for handling disclosure of \nfuture discoveries of presumed iatrogenesis (e.g., that of iatrogenic \nAlzheimer's disease).\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

However, \nthe molecular base for governing such functionality of TAMs remains poorly \nunderstood. Thereby, we here explore the impact of such a key regulatory \ntranscription factor NFE2L1 (also called Nrf1) on glioma-relevant TAMs.\nMETHODS: A set of combining in\u2009vivo and in\u2009vitro experimental approaches, e.g., \nby utilizing CRISPR-Cas9 and overexpression plasmids to modulate NFE2L1 \nexpression, and the resulting phenotypic changes in TAMs were evaluated. \nBesides, immunofluorescence, RT-qPCR and flow cytometry were conducted to assay \nthe infiltration of various immune cells, such as CD8+ T cells and M1-type \nmacrophages, in the glioma microenvironment, as well as their therapeutic \nresponse to anti-PD1 treatment.\nRESULTS: Deficiency of NFE2L1 causes a unique phenotypic switch in the TAMs from \nits pro-cancer M2-type to another anti-cancer M1-type, thereby inhibiting \nmalignant progression of glioma. Such NFE2L1-deficiency leads to significantly \nincreases of CD8+ T cells and M1 macrophages within tumor tissues of glioma and \nhence enhances its sensitivity to anti-PD1 therapy. Further experimental \nevidence has provided revealing a synergistic efficacy triggered by combined \ntherapy of CD38 inhibitor with PD1 antibodies, significantly inhibited tumor \ngrowth, compared to that of their monotherapy. The mechanistic study unraveled \nthat NFE2L1 enables for directly binding to those ARE sites within the promoter \nregions of both CD38 and PD-L1 genes in order to govern their transcriptional \nexpression.\nCONCLUSIONS: The aberrant role of NFE2L1 in the malignant progression of glioma \nwas discovered in this study. It is of crucial significance to emphasize the \npotential of NFE2L1 inhibition as a strategic approach to enhance the efficacy \nof immunotherapeutic intervention. Overall, this discovery holds a substantial \npromise for advancement of innovative combination therapies, potentially \nenhancing treatment outcomes for individuals afflicted with glioma.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

Methods: Data were collected from the China \nKadoorie Biobank project conducted in Pengzhou, Sichuan Province. Using the Cox \nproportional hazards regression model, we analyzed the associations of the \nfrequency of spicy food intake, spicy level, types of spicy food, and the age \nwhen regular intake of spicy food began (intake in 1 day/week), with the risk \nfor cardio/cerebrovascular disease. Furthermore, the associations with the risks \nfor ischemic heart disease (IHD) and cerebrovascular diseases, as well as the \nrisk of ischemic stroke (IS) and hemorrhagic stroke (HS) were analyzed. Results: \nA total of 54 859 study participants were included in the study, in whom 49 320 \nhad spicy food intake (89.90%). In these participants, 37 680 (68.69%) had spicy \nfood intake in 6-7 days/week, 5 036 (9.18%) had spicy food intake in 1-5 \ndays/week, and 6 604 (12.03%) had spicy food intake once a week; 5 539 (10.10%) \nhad never/almost never had spicy food intake. After adjusting for multiple \nconfounding factors, compared with those who never/almost never had spicy food \nintake, intake of spicy food was associated with reduced risks for IHD (intake \nin 6-7 days/week: HR=0.86, 95%CI: 0.78-0.95), cerebrovascular diseases (intake \nin 6-7 days/week: HR=0.88, 95%CI: 0.81-0.96), and IS (intak in 6-7 days/week: \nHR=0.85, 95%CI: 0.76-0.95). With the increase of spicy food intake frequency, \nthe risk for cardio/cerebrovascular disease decreased (intake in 1-5 days/week: \nHR=0.91, 95%CI: 0.85-0.98; intake in 6-7 days/week: HR=0.89, 95%CI: 0.84-0.94) \n(trend test P<0.001). However, no statistical association was found between \nspicy food intake and the risk for HS. In terms of spicy level, after adjusting \nfor multiple confounding factors, compared with those who never/almost never had \nspicy food intake, intake of spicy food was associated with reduced risk for \ncardio/cerebrovascular disease (moderate: HR=0.86, 95%CI: 0.82-0.90) and \ncerebrovascular disease (moderate: HR=0.90, 95%CI: 0.84-0.97). With the increase \nof spicy level, the risk for IHD decreased (moderate: HR=0.86, 95%CI: 0.79-0.93; \nstrong: HR=0.84, 95%CI: 0.74-0.95) (trend test P<0.001). After adjusting for \nmultiple confounding factors, compared with those who never/almost never had \nspicy food intake, intake of any type of spicy food was associated with reduced \nrisk for cardio/cerebrovascular disease, IHD, and cerebrovascular disease. \nRegulat intake of spicy food from age 0-10 years was associated with reduced \nrisk for cardio/cerebrovascular disease, IHD, and cerebrovascular disease. \nRegular intake of spicy food from age 11-20 years reduced the risk for \ncardio/cerebrovascular disease and IHD. There was no significant association \nbetween the regular intake of spicy food from age 21-79 years and the risks for \ncardio/cerebrovascular disease, IHD and cerebrovascular disease. Conclusion: The \nintake of spicy food could reduced the risk for cardio/cerebrovascular diseases, \nIHD, cerebrovascular diseases and IS in residents aged 30-79 years in Sichuan.\n\nPublisher: \u76ee\u7684\uff1a \u63a2\u8ba8\u8fa3\u98df\u6444\u5165\u4e0e\u5fc3\u8111\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u53d1\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002 \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a \n\u5229\u7528\u4e2d\u56fd\u6162\u6027\u75c5\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u56db\u5ddd\u7701\u5f6d\u5dde\u5e02\u9879\u76ee\u70b9\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Cox\u6bd4\u4f8b\u98ce\u9669\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u8fa3\u98df\u6444\u5165\u9891\u7387\u3001\u504f\u597d\u8fa3\u5ea6\u3001\u8fa3\u98df\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u5f00\u59cb\u4e60\u60ef\u6027\uff08\u22651 \nd/\u5468\uff09\u6444\u5165\u8fa3\u98df\u5e74\u9f84\u4e0e\u5fc3\u8111\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u53d1\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u5176\u4e0e\u7f3a\u8840\u6027\u5fc3\u810f\u75c5\uff08IHD\uff09\u548c\u8111\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f3a\u8840\u6027\u8111\u5352\u4e2d\uff08IS\uff09\u3001\u51fa\u8840\u6027\u8111\u5352\u4e2d\uff08HS\uff092\u79cd\u8111\u5352\u4e2d\u4e9a\u578b\u53d1\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002 \n\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a \u5171\u7eb3\u516554 859\u540d\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c49 320\u540d\uff0889.90%\uff09\u6444\u5165\u8fa3\u98df\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d37 680\u540d\uff0868.69%\uff09\u8fa3\u98df\u6444\u5165\u9891\u7387\u4e3a6~7 d/\u5468\uff0c5 \n036\u540d\uff089.18%\uff09\u8fa3\u98df\u6444\u5165\u9891\u7387\u4e3a1~5 d/\u5468\uff0c6 604\u540d\uff0812.03%\uff09\u6444\u5165\u9891\u7387<1 \u6b21/\u5468\uff0c5 \n539\u540d\uff0810.10%\uff09\u4ece\u4e0d/\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u6444\u5165\u8fa3\u98df\u3002\u63a7\u5236\u591a\u4e2a\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\u540e\uff0c\u4e0e\u4ece\u4e0d/\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u6444\u5165\u8fa3\u98df\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8fa3\u98df\u6444\u5165\u53ef\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4eIHD\uff086~7 \nd/\u5468\uff1aHR=0.86\uff0c95%CI\uff1a0.78~0.95\uff09\u3001\u8111\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\uff086~7 d/\u5468\uff1aHR=0.88\uff0c95%CI\uff1a0.81~0.96\uff09\u53caIS\uff086~7 \nd/\u5468\uff1aHR=0.85\uff0c95%CI\uff1a0.76~0.95\uff09\u7684\u53d1\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\uff1b\u968f\u7740\u8fa3\u98df\u6444\u5165\u9891\u7387\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5fc3\u8111\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\uff081~5 \nd/\u5468\uff1aHR=0.91\uff0c95%CI\uff1a0.85~0.98\uff1b6~7 \nd/\u5468\uff1aHR=0.89\uff0c95%CI\uff1a0.84~0.94\uff09\u7684\u53d1\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\u964d\u4f4e\uff08\u8d8b\u52bf\u68c0\u9a8cP<0.001\uff09\uff1b\u4e0eHS\u7684\u53d1\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u5173\u8054\u3002\u5c31\u504f\u597d\u8fa3\u5ea6\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u591a\u4e2a\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\u540e\uff0c\u4e0e\u4ece\u4e0d/\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u6444\u5165\u8fa3\u98df\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8fa3\u98df\u6444\u5165\u53ef\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u5fc3\u8111\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\uff08\u4e2d\u8fa3\uff1aHR=0.86\uff0c95%CI\uff1a0.82~0.90\uff09\u3001\u8111\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\uff08\u4e2d\u8fa3\uff1aHR=0.90\uff0c95%CI\uff1a0.84~0.97\uff09\u7684\u53d1\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\uff1b\u968f\u7740\u8fa3\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0cIHD\uff08\u4e2d\u8fa3\uff1aHR=0.86\uff0c95%CI\uff1a0.79~0.93\uff1b\u91cd\u8fa3\uff1aHR=0.84\uff0c95%CI\uff1a0.74~0.95\uff09\u7684\u53d1\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\u964d\u4f4e\uff08\u8d8b\u52bf\u68c0\u9a8cP<0.001\uff09\u3002\u63a7\u5236\u591a\u4e2a\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\u540e\uff0c\u4e0e\u4ece\u4e0d/\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u6444\u5165\u8fa3\u98df\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6444\u5165\u4efb\u4f55\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u8fa3\u98df\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u5fc3\u8111\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u3001IHD\u548c\u8111\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u53d1\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\uff1b0~10\u5c81\u5f00\u59cb\u4e60\u60ef\u6027\u6444\u5165\u8fa3\u98df\u53ef\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u5fc3\u8111\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u3001IHD\u548c\u8111\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u53d1\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\uff1b11~20\u5c81\u5f00\u59cb\u4e60\u60ef\u6027\u6444\u5165\u8fa3\u98df\u53ef\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u5fc3\u8111\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u3001IHD\u53d1\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\uff1b21~79\u5c81\u5f00\u59cb\u4e60\u60ef\u6027\u6444\u5165\u8fa3\u98df\u4e0e\u5fc3\u8111\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u3001IHD\u548c\u8111\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u53d1\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u5173\u8054\u3002 \n\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a \u8fa3\u98df\u6444\u5165\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u56db\u5ddd\u770130~79\u5c81\u5c45\u6c11\u5fc3\u8111\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u3001IHD\u3001\u8111\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u3001IS\u7684\u53d1\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\u3002.\n\nDOI: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20241227-00833\nPMID: 40677177 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n21.

We also gathered their feedback about the \nsupportive care intervention we were proposing (Phase I). Following Phase I, we \nconducted a single-arm pilot to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of \nthe 6-session intervention (Phase II).\nRESULTS: During interviews (N = 14), patients and caregivers reported having the \nmost difficulty and distress surrounding disease progression and management, \nmaintaining dignity and autonomy, negotiation of roles and responsibilities, and \nmaintaining connection with one another. Participants endorsed that an \nintervention like Empower GBM with skills focused on managing symptoms to \nincrease independence, increasing caregiving efficacy and support, and coping \nwith dyadic challenges would be of potential benefit. Preliminary results from \nthe pilot study (N = 11) suggested the intervention is both feasible (e.g., 82% \ncompleted all 6 sessions and post-treatment surveys) and acceptable (88.9% \nreported a mean satisfaction score of 3 or higher; mean score of 3.57/4.0). \nImprovements in psychological outcomes, functional well-being, and caregiving \nefficacy from pre- to post-treatment survey results suggested the potential \nbenefits of the intervention.\nSIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: We developed a novel supportive care intervention \ninformed by the dyadic illness model that is designed to meet the individual and \ninterpersonal needs of patients with glioblastoma and their caregivers. Unique \nfeatures include its flexibility to be delivered to patients and/or their family \ncaregivers individually or jointly, while providing skills and strategies to \nmeet the needs of both individuals and the dyad as the unit of care in coping \nwith glioblastoma.\n\nDOI: 10.1017/S1478951525100436\nPMID: 40676955 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n22.

These \ndisorders, including postoperative delirium and sustained cognitive decline, \nsignificantly reduce patient quality of life and impose substantial burdens on \nhealthcare systems. Despite extensive research, the underlying \npathophysiological mechanisms remain inadequately understood, limiting the \ndevelopment of effective treatments. Increasing evidence highlights \nneuroinflammation as a central factor in PND, with microglia-the resident immune \ncells of the central nervous system-playing a key role in mediating inflammatory \nresponses that lead to cognitive dysfunction.\nMETHODS: This review comprehensively analyzes the role of microglia in the \npathogenesis of PND. It details key perioperative triggers of microglial \nactivation, such as surgical stress, anesthesia, and systemic inflammation. The \nreview further examines preclinical interventions aimed at modulating microglial \nfunction, including depletion strategies, polarization toward anti-inflammatory \nphenotypes, and inhibition of inflammatory pathways like NF-\u03baB and NLRP3.\nRESULTS: Preclinical studies demonstrate that dysregulated microglial activation \nresults in excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, \nand synaptic disruptions, which collectively contribute to neuronal injury and \ncognitive impairment. Interventions targeting microglial activation have shown \nefficacy in reducing neuroinflammation and preserving cognitive function in \nanimal models.\nCONCLUSIONS: Targeting microglial activation represents a promising strategy for \nalleviating PND. However, challenges remain in clinical translation, \nnecessitating advanced drug delivery platforms, personalized therapeutic \napproaches, and rigorous clinical validation. Advances in microglial modulation \nhold potential for improving postoperative cognitive outcomes and enhancing \npatient recovery.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

While most individuals \nrecover HPGA function following androgen cessation, a subset experiences \nprolonged hypogonadism, with symptoms persisting for months or even years. \nCurrently, this condition lacks a standardized definition, complicating both \ndiagnosis and treatment. In this article, we explore the potential mechanisms \nunderlying prolonged hypogonadism after androgen abuse, including the role of \nprolonged androgen activity, hypothalamic-pituitary alterations, testicular \nchanges, suppression of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), genetic \npredisposition, and undisclosed ongoing androgen abuse. We propose the term \n'Prolonged Post-Androgen Abuse Hypogonadism'(PPAAH) to standardize diagnosis and \nguide future research. PPAAH is provisionally defined as persistent hypogonadism \nsix months after cessation of androgen abuse, in individuals with a cumulative \nandrogen exposure of at least 150 mg per week for a minimum of six months. \nDiagnosing PPAAH requires excluding other causes of hypogonadism. This \npreliminary framework is intended to support further research into the \npathophysiology and management of this condition, and may require refinement as \nfurther evidence emerges.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 van Os, Smit, Bond and de Ronde.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fendo.2025.1621558\nPMCID: PMC12267013\nPMID: 40678315 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n24.

Ltd., Suzhou Industrial Park, Suzhou, \nJiangsu, China.\n(4)Changchun Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural \nSciences, Changchun, Jilin, China.\n\nPurpose: The study was aimed at identifying the pathogenic gene responsible for \nX-linked nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL) in a five-generation Chinese family \nand at elucidating the gene's function both in vivo using a zebrafish model and \nin vitro using PRPS1 knockdown HEI-OC1 cells. Methods: Exome sequencing (ES) and \nSanger sequencing were used to identify the pathogenic variants. A transgenic \nzebrafish model overexpressing the novel PRPS1 variant (c.494G>A: p.Cys165Tyr) \nwas constructed, and PRPS1 was knocked down in HEI-OC1 cells using siRNA to \nexplore the underlying mechanisms. Hair cell development and behavior were \nassessed in zebrafish, and mitochondrial function and cell viability were \nanalyzed in HEI-OC1 cells. Results: A novel missense variant (c.494G>A: \np.Cys165Tyr) in the PRPS1 gene was identified as the pathogenic variant causing \nprogressive X-linked deafness-1 (DFNX1). The variant led to hair cell death in \nzebrafish, with disrupted swimming behavior. In HEI-OC1 cells, PRPS1 knockdown \nresulted in downregulation of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide \n(NAD+)/sirtuin 3 (SIRT3)/superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) pathway, increased \nreactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and \napoptosis, which were partially rescued by pretreatment with nicotinamide \nmononucleotide (NMN), a precursor of NAD+. Conclusion: The study reports a novel \nPRPS1 variant contributing to the variant spectrum of PRPS1 and highlights the \nrole of PRPS1 deficiency in increasing oxidative stress-induced hair cell \napoptosis via the NAD+/SIRT3/SOD2 pathway. These findings provide new insights \ninto the molecular mechanisms of PRPS1-related hearing loss and potential \ntherapeutic targets.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Yining Wan et al.

Activation of the transient receptor \npotential vanilloid subtype 1 (TRPV1) cascade plays a key role in lipid \nmetabolism and energy intake. TRPV1 is expressed across the central nervous \nsystem and peripheral organs is involved in the regulation of hormone secretion, \nappetite and mitochondrial function, and is recognized as one of the key targets \nfor preventing obesity. The current treatments for obesity exhibit limited \nefficacy and are associated with numerous side effects. Targeting TRPV1 \nrepresents a potentially effective approach for managing obesity. In this work, \nby combining the recent mechanism of the role of TRPV1 in neuroendocrine \nregulation, we hope to provide novel approaches to block or even reverse the \ndevelopment of obesity.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Wang, Liu, Wen, Xing, Chen, Xia and Ding.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1598804\nPMCID: PMC12267016\nPMID: 40677717 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n26.

By \namplifying neural responses to chemicals such as histamine, OSM increases \nsensitivity to pruritus. However, the morphological effects of OSM on peripheral \nsensory nerves and their subsequent impact on pruritus remain unclear. This \nstudy investigated OSM-induced peripheral nerve elongation, which may contribute \nto skin hypersensitivity.\nMETHODS: We assessed neurite outgrowth using primary mouse dorsal root ganglion \n(DRG) cells treated with OSM, IL-31, or nerve growth factor. Next, we \npre-treated the cells with inhibitors of downstream signaling pathways of OSM, \nincluding extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), signal transducers and \nactivator of transcription (STAT) 3, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38, \nfollowed by OSM administration to measure neurite outgrowth. Furthermore, OSM \nreceptor \u03b2-overexpressing cell lines were established by gene transfer into the \nDRG cell line, and nerve elongation was measured after OSM administration. In \nvivo studies involved OSM administration in mouse skin models. \nImmunofluorescence staining was used to evaluate nerve elongation. We examined \nwhether OSM-infused mice had increased hypersensitivity to mechanical \nstimuli-induced pruritus. Various cytokine stimuli were applied to CD4+ T cells \nisolated from healthy humans to examine the conditions under which OSM \nproduction increases.\nRESULTS: OSM significantly induced neurite outgrowth in DRG cells and the effect \nof OSM surpassed the effects of IL-31 and nerve growth factor. The neurite \noutgrowth effect of OSM involved the JAK/STAT3, MEK/ERK, and p38/MAPK pathways. \nCompared to control cells, DRG cell lines that overexpressed OSM receptor \u03b2 \nshowed significantly enhanced neurite outgrowth upon OSM treatment. In vivo, OSM \ntreatment increased nerve elongation in the mouse dermis. Behavioral assays in \nmice showed that OSM administration increased sensitivity to mechanical stimuli. \nIL-4 and TNF\u03b1 increased OSM production in CD4+ T cells.\nCONCLUSION: OSM induces neurite elongation and may contribute to skin \nhypersensitivity. This suggests the potential utilization of OSM as a \ntherapeutic target for inflammatory skin diseases such as AD.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Ishikawa, Saito, Suehiro, Ishii, Yanase, Kawaguchi, Uchida, \nYanagida, Numata, Sasaki, Kamigaki, Takeno and Tanaka.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1571120\nPMCID: PMC12267034\nPMID: 40677708 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: AT has received speaker honoraria from Eli \nLilly, Kaken Pharmaceutical, Sanofi, Taiho Pharmaceutical, AbbVie, Pfizer, \nKyorin Pharmaceutical, Mitsubishi Tanabe, Torii Pharmaceutical, and Maruho, and \na research grant from Maruho.

Liposomal bupivacaine (LB) \noffers prolonged analgesia, potentially improving pain control and reducing \nopioid use. This study evaluates LB's effectiveness and safety in thoracic \npostoperative pain management, aiming to provide an alternative to current \npractices. Methods: In this single-center, double-blind, prospective, randomized \ncontrolled trial, patients undergoing uniportal lobectomy, segmentectomy, or \nwedge resection from November 2023 to May 2024 were enrolled. Participants were \nrandomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 0.375% ropivacaine (control \ngroup, n\u2009=\u200957) or LB (LB group, n\u2009=\u200956) for intercostal nerve blocks (ICNBs). \nPostoperative visual analog scale (VAS) scores, opioid consumption, overall \nbenefit of analgesia score (OBAS), chest tube duration, length of hospital stay, \nand adverse events (AEs) were recorded and analyzed. Results: Data from 57 \npatients in the control group and 56 patients in the LB group were included in \nthe analysis, with no significant demographic differences between the groups. \nThe LB group demonstrated lower VAS scores at rest and during activity (p > \n0.05), reduced opioid consumption (p=0.021), and higher OBAS (p < 0.01) compared \nwith the control group. No significant differences were observed in chest tube \nduration, length of hospital stay, or AEs between the groups. Conclusion: LB is \nsafe and effective for ICNB, providing significant postoperative pain relief for \npatients undergoing uniportal thoracoscopic surgery.

LAL was lost \nwith age in mice and humans with greater losses in AD and inverse associations \nwith amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2). LAL loss preceded A\u03b2 pathology in AD mice, and neuronal LAL \nknockdown enhanced pathology and cognitive decline.

Radiological data were also collected from two pre-symptomatic carriers.\nRESULTS: All participants had heterozygous c.1184A\u00a0>\u00a0G, p.Asp395Gly in VCP. All \nsymptomatic cases exhibited cognitive, behavioral, and/or language dysfunction \nindicative of FTD in their 30s to 50s.

However, the specific roles of cortical structure features and \ncerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metabolites in VTE risk remain \nunderexplored.MethodsUsing Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, we examined \nassociations between cortical features, CSF metabolites and VTE. Mediation MR \nand co-localization analyses were employed to explore genetic pathways and \npotential mediatory effects.ResultsMR analysis initially identified associations \nbetween six cortical features and fifteen CSF metabolites with VTE. After false \ndiscovery rate (FDR) correction, lingual gyrus thickness remained statistically \nsignificant, while isoleucine and methylmalonate showed suggestive associations. \nMediation MR analysis revealed no causal relationship between lingual gyrus \nthickness and the CSF metabolites isoleucine or methylmalonate. Co-localization \nanalysis indicated low posterior probabilities for shared genetic variants, \nsuggesting that these traits influence venous thromboembolism (VTE) through \ndistinct biological mechanisms.ConclusionThe findings suggest that MRI-based \ncortical structure features and CSF profiling hold potential as complementary \ntools for assessing VTE risk. Further research is warranted to investigate the \nneurovascular and metabolic mechanisms underlying VTE.\n\nDOI: 10.1177/10760296251360018\nPMID: 40676946 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe authors \ndeclared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, \nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\n\n31.

The \u03b11-adrenergic receptor (ADRA1), a G \nprotein-coupled receptor, has been identified as a critical therapeutic target \nin inflammatory disorders. However, its precise mechanistic role in AD \npathogenesis remains unclear.\nMETHODS: To investigate ADRA1's role in AD, we employed 3xTg-AD and wild-type \n(WT) mice, modulating neuronal ADRA1 expression via intracerebroventricular \ndelivery of adeno-associated viruses. Cognitive function, tau pathology, \nneuronal morphology, and activation of the STING/NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 signaling pathway \nwere evaluated using behavioral tests, Western blot, Golgi-Cox staining, \nimmunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence. In vitro AD models were \nestablished using A\u03b242 oligomer-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells and primary murine \nneurons, along with SH-SY5Y cells transfected with full-length human tau \n(SH-SY5Y/htau). Pharmacological antagonists, inhibitors, lentiviral \ntransduction, co-immunoprecipitation, and calcium flux assays were utilized to \ndissect ADRA1-mediated molecular mechanisms in tauopathy and neuroinflammation.\nRESULTS: Hippocampal ADRA1 expression was significantly elevated in 10-month-old \n3xTg-AD mice. Neuronal ADRA1 knockdown suppressed STING/NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 pathway \nactivation, ameliorated tauopathy and neuroinflammation, restored neuronal \nstructure/function, and improved cognitive deficits in 3xTg-AD mice. Conversely, \nADRA1 overexpression in C57/BL6 mice induced tauopathy, neuroinflammation, and \ncognitive impairment. Mechanistically, ADRA1 interacts with CXCR4 to form \nheterodimers, triggering cytoplasmic Ca2\u207a overload and subsequent \nSTING/NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 pathway activation.\nCONCLUSIONS: ADRA1 critically mediates tauopathy and neuroinflammation through \nSTING/NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 signaling. These results identify ADRA1 as a promising \ntherapeutic target for AD prevention and treatment.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

We \nhypothesized that ELS mediates prolonged cognitive dysfunction after mTBI by \nexacerbating the NRLP3 inflammasome signaling pathway, and that these effects \ncould be reversed by inhibiting NLRP3.\nMETHODS: To test this hypothesis, Sprague Dawley rat pups were maternally \nseparated for 3\u00a0h daily from P2-P14. Subsequently, the rats underwent a \nmild-to-moderate fluid percussion brain injury (1.4\u00a0atm) or sham surgery during \nyoung adulthood and were then treated with either the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 or \nvehicle.\nRESULTS: We found that ELS significantly increased microglia and macrophage cell \nnumbers within the hippocampus during mTBI recovery. Quantitative PCR \ndemonstrated that the combination of ELS and mTBI significantly increased levels \nof HMGB1, TLR4, NLRP3, caspase 1, and IL-1\u03b2 mRNA levels in the ipsilateral \nhippocampus at 24\u00a0h after injury. This upregulation was persistent and TLR4, \nNLRP3, caspase 1, and IL-1\u03b2 levels remained elevated for up to 2 months after \ninjury. Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 reduced this \nupregulation both 24\u00a0h and 2 months after injury. Hippocampal microglia isolated \nby fluorescence-activated cell sorting demonstrated increased levels of NLRP3 \nafter ELS alone, but not IL-1\u03b2. The upregulation in microglial IL-1\u03b2 required \nthe combination of ELS and mTBI and was ameliorated with MCC950. Additionally, \nMCC950 treatment improved glucocorticoid receptor downregulation in the \nhippocampus after ELS, mTBI alone and mTBI\u2009+\u2009ELS. The combinatory insult of ELS \nand mTBI also impaired associative fear memory which was prevented with MCC950 \ntreatment.\nCONCLUSION: In summary, ELS limits recovery after mTBI by upregulating the \nexpression of NLRP3 inflammasome signaling molecules in microglia. Inhibition of \nNLRP3 is an effective therapeutic for treating chronic cognitive deficits after \nELS and mTBI.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

It is characterized by \ndistinct clinical (diplopia, ataxia, dysarthria, and altered facial sensation), \nradiological (punctiform lesions detected on magnetic resonance imaging), and \nhistopathological (predominantly perivascular lymphocytic infiltration, mainly \naffecting the pons and cerebellum) features. The condition typically \ndemonstrates a favorable response to corticosteroid therapy.\nCASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 54-year-old Caucasian European male \nwho presented with clinical and radiological findings consistent with chronic \nlymphocytic inflammation with pontine perivascular enhancement responsive to \nsteroids. The patient attended the emergency department at his referral hospital \nfollowing a 1-month history of progressive neurological symptoms, including \ndiplopia, blurred vision, facial paresis, and gait disturbance attributed to \nlower limb weakness. Given the clinical presentation and magnetic resonance \nimaging findings, treatment with oral prednisolone (70\u00a0mg/day) was initiated. At \n2 weeks post-treatment initiation, the patient exhibited significant clinical \nimprovement, with complete resolution of neurological symptoms. A follow-up \nbrain magnetic resonance imaging scan, performed at the referral center 1 month \nafter starting corticosteroid therapy, demonstrated a reduction in both the size \nand number of hyperintense lesions in the brainstem on T2-weighted sequences, \nalong with resolution of contrast enhancement. These radiological findings \nindicated a favorable therapeutic response to chronic lymphocytic inflammation \nwith pontine perivascular enhancement responsive to steroids treatment. At the \n1-month follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic, leading to a gradual \ntapering of corticosteroid therapy in light of both clinical and radiological \nimprovement.\nCONCLUSION: Chronic lymphocytic inflammation with pontine perivascular \nenhancement responsive to steroids is a rare neurological disorder that \ntypically presents with ataxic gait, diplopia, and dysarthria. Diagnosis is \nbased on a combination of clinical features, neuroimaging, and histopathology, \nalthough brain biopsy is not always feasible. The cornerstone of treatment is \nimmunosuppressive therapy, primarily with corticosteroids, often supplemented \nwith other immunosuppressive agents to prevent relapse.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

However, polygenic risk scores, the \nmost widely used method for genetic risk prediction, have notable limitations \ndue to their linear nature and inability to capture complex, nonlinear \ninteractions among genetic variants. While deep neural networks offer advantages \nin modeling these complex relationships, the multifactorial nature of IS and the \ninfluence of modifiable risk factors present additional challenges for genetic \nrisk prediction. To address these challenges, we propose a Chromosome-wise \nMulti-task Genomic (MetaGeno) framework that utilizes genetic data from IS and \nfive related diseases. The framework includes a chromosome-based embedding layer \nto model local and global interactions among adjacent variants, enabling a \nbiologically informed approach. Incorporating multi-disease learning further \nenhances predictive accuracy by leveraging shared genetic information. Among \nvarious sequential models tested, the Transformer demonstrated superior \nperformance, and outperformed other machine learning models and PRS baselines, \nachieving an AUROC of 0.809 on the UK Biobank dataset. Risk stratification \nidentified a two-fold increased stroke risk (HR, 2.14; 95% CI: 1.81-2.46) in the \ntop 1% risk group, with a nearly five-fold increase in those with modifiable \nrisk factors such as atrial fibrillation and hypertension.

The present research examines the association \nbetween stroke risk and both the triglyceride glucose-weight adjusted waist \nindex (TyG-WWI, a composite marker of insulin resistance and obesity) and its \ncumulative exposure (CumTyG-WWI).\nMETHODS: A total of 4,718 participants without baseline stroke history were \nincluded in this investigation, with new-onset stroke cases identified as the \nmain study outcome. Cumulative exposure to the TyG-WWI was calculated based on \nrepeated measurement data from the first and third waves of the national \nsurveys. The relationships of TyG-WWI and CumTyG-WWI with stroke risk were \nexamined using multivariable Cox regression, followed by validation in \nsensitivity analyses.\nRESULTS: Within a six-year median tracking period, 350 cases of stroke were \ndocumented among the research subjects. Following adjustment for confounding \nvariables, the Cox regression analysis indicated progressively higher stroke \nrisk with increasing TyG-WWI or CumTyG-WWI levels. Multiple sensitivity analyses \nfurther confirmed the robustness of these findings. Additionally, subgroup \nanalysis results demonstrated significant differences in stroke risk associated \nwith TyG-WWI and CumTyG-WWI across different age strata; specifically, \nindividuals aged 45-59 years had a relatively higher stroke risk at similarly \nhigh levels of TyG-WWI and CumTyG-WWI compared to those aged\u2009\u2265\u200960 years.\nCONCLUSION: Elevated baseline TyG-WWI was significantly associated with \nincreased stroke risk. Moreover, the increasing cumulative exposure of TyG-WWI \nover time further elevates the risk of stroke occurrence.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

We aimed to evaluate stroke and major \nbleeding risk in patients with atrial fibrillation using rivaroxaban, apixaban, \ndabigatran and the effects of using antiplatelet, atorvastatin and proton pump \ninhibitor (PPI) on development of stroke.\nMETHODS: Patients who were administered rivaroxaban, dabigatran or apixaban for \natrial fibrillation between June 2014 and December 2020 were retrospectively \nanalysed. Demographic data, CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores, HAS-BLED scores, \nantiplatelet, proton pump inhibitor, atorvastatin medications were evaluated. \nFurthermore, we evaluated the risk of major bleeding and stroke during \ntreatment.\nRESULTS: We investigated 162 patients using dabigatran, 255 patients using \nrivaroxaban and 104 patients using apixaban. No significant difference was \nobserved between the groups in terms of CHA2DS2-VASc scores and the use of \natorvastatin, proton pump inhibitor and antiplatelet. HAS-BLED scores before \nDOACs treatment were statistically significantly higher in the apixaban group \ncompared to rivaroxaban and dabigatran groups (p\u2009=\u20090.038); we found no \ndifference between the study groups in terms of major bleeding (p\u2009=\u20090.528) and \nstroke risk (p\u2009=\u20090.498). The use of antiplatelet, proton pump inhibitor and \natorvastatin did not have a significant effect on stroke risk (p\u2009=\u20090.533, \np\u2009=\u20090.169 and p\u2009=\u20090.949).\nCONCLUSION: Rivaroxaban, dabigatran and apixaban have similar safety and \nefficacy for stroke prophylaxis. The use of antiplatelet, proton pump inhibitor \nand atorvastatin did not have a significant effect on stroke risk.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Previous studies have demonstrated that SCCA supplementation can \nimprove functional recovery, with one recent study suggesting this occurs via \nmodulation of microglial responses. However, the effects of individual SCCAs on \nmicroglial responses remain unclear, particularly across sexes and following a \nmore clinically relevant, post-stroke treatment protocol. To address this gap, \nwe investigated the effect of post-stroke supplementation with butyrate on \nstroke outcomes and microglial responses in both male and female mice over time.\nRESULTS: Post-stroke butyrate treatment produced sex-specific microglial \nresponses. In females, butyrate increased microglial ramification at chronic \ntimepoints in vivo and enhanced IL6 release following IFN\u03b3 stimulation in vitro. \nThese microglial changes were not observed in males. Despite the distinct \nmicroglial responses, butyrate treatment did not correlate with improved stroke \noutcomes in either sex, as measured by lesion volume and functional recovery.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal previously unknown sex differences in \nmicroglial responses to butyrate following stroke. Despite these microglial \nchanges in females, butyrate treatment did not improve functional outcomes in \neither sex, suggesting that sex-specific optimization of dosing and delivery may \nbe needed for therapeutic efficacy.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

This systematic review and \nmeta-analysis evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of brain stimulation modalities \non postural control, comparing outcomes between stroke survivors and \nneurologically intact adults through controlled trials. Systematic searches were \nconducted across major databases (CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science) for \nrandomized controlled trials and crossover studies published from 2014 to 2024. \nStudy quality was assessed using the Risk of Bias 2 tool, with treatment effects \nanalyzed through standardized mean differences in a random-effects model. \nAnalysis of 15 studies revealed significant overall effects of brain stimulation \n(SMD\u2009=\u20090.79, 95% CI 0.47-1.11), with notably stronger responses in stroke \nparticipants (SMD\u2009=\u20090.95) versus neurologically intact individuals (SMD\u2009=\u20090.39). \nTranscranial direct current stimulation showed particular efficacy in stroke \nrehabilitation (SMD\u2009=\u20091.79), while intermittent theta burst stimulation \ndemonstrated moderate effects (SMD\u2009=\u20090.68). Primary motor cortex stimulation \nyielded optimal outcomes (SMD\u2009=\u20091.21), followed by cerebellar (SMD\u2009=\u20090.75) and \ndorsolateral prefrontal cortex interventions (SMD\u2009=\u20090.35). These findings reveal \ndifferential response patterns between populations and stimulation parameters, \nsuggesting enhanced neuroplastic potential in stroke survivors. This evidence \nsupports the development of targeted neuromodulatory approaches for \nrehabilitation and performance enhancement.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

This meta-analysis aimed to assess the \ncomparative effectiveness and safety of IVT vs nonthrombolytic standard of care \n(NT-SC) in minor strokes, focusing exclusively on data from randomized \ncontrolled trials (RCTs).\nMETHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify RCTs \nevaluating IVT in minor stroke, defined as a NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score \u22645. \nThe primary outcome was excellent functional recovery, defined as a modified \nRankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-1 at 90 days. Secondary outcomes included \nfunctional independence (mRS 0-2 at 90 days) and safety end points, including \n90-day mortality, recurrent stroke, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), \nand any ICH. The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024621714).\nRESULTS: The primary analysis included data from 4 RCTs that exclusively \nenrolled patients with minor stroke (N = 3,364; age range: 56-80 years). \nSecondary analyses incorporated post hoc and subgroup data on patients with \nminor stroke from earlier RCTs. In the primary analysis, IVT was not \nsignificantly associated with higher odds of excellent functional recovery at 90 \ndays compared with NT-SC (mRS 0-1; odds ratio [OR] 0.85, 95% CI 0.70-1.03). IVT \nwas significantly associated with lower odds of achieving 90-day functional \nindependence (mRS 0-2; OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.55-0.91) and higher odds of both sICH \n(OR 5.22, 95% CI 1.76-15.48) and 90-day mortality (OR 2.40, 95% CI 1.23-4.67) \ncompared with NT-SC. Subgroup analysis showed a nonsignificant association of \nIVT with odds of excellent functional recovery across both groups with disabling \nsymptoms (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.38-1.88) and nondisabling symptoms (OR 0.82, 95% CI \n0.66-1.03). The pooled analysis, which incorporated nonoverlapping subgroups and \npost hoc data, yielded consistent findings.\nDISCUSSION: The findings suggest that IVT does not confer improved functional \noutcomes among patients with minor strokes and can be associated with higher \nodds of sICH and mortality at 90 days compared with NT-SC. Since most of the \nincluded patients presented with nondisabling minor strokes, additional studies \non patients with mildly disabling symptoms are warranted.\n\nDOI: 10.1212/WNL.0000000000213863\nPMID: 40674672 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n40.

Possible stroke events were validated by medical record \nreview. Age-adjusted incidence rates and absolute changes in incidence rates \nwere estimated by Poisson regression analysis. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to \nestimate 30-day, 1-year, and 5-year cumulative mortality risks.\nRESULTS: Between 2013 and 2020, the age-adjusted stroke incidence rate increased \nin male individuals while no change was noted in female individuals. The trend \nobserved in male individuals was driven by the increased incidence rate of \narterial ischemic stroke (AIS) (yearly absolute change per 100,000 person-years: \n0.14, 95% CI 0.018-0.26). The 30-day, 1-year, and 5-year cumulative mortality \nrisks were 7.7% (95% CI 4.2-11.2), 10.0% (95% CI 6.0-13.9), and 11.0% (95% CI \n6.8-15.2), respectively. Mortality risk remained stable over time (p value = \n0.77). Among children alive at follow-up, moderate-severe neurologic impairment \nwas present in 20.2% with AIS and 23.1% with intracerebral hemorrhage.\nDISCUSSION: From 2013 through 2020, the age-adjusted incidence rate of pediatric \nstroke increased in male individuals while remaining stable in female \nindividuals. Morbidity and mortality after stroke were substantial, highlighting \nthe need for further improvements in pediatric stroke management.\n\nDOI: 10.1212/WNL.0000000000213901\nPMID: 40674669 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n41.

While this treatment modality can improve survival, \ntreatment-related complications may include radiation-induced vasculopathy and \nincreased risk of stroke. We aimed to evaluate the stroke frequency, associated \nrisk factors, and outcomes after cranial radiation therapy in patients with \nglioma.\nMETHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study at a single tertiary academic \nbrain tumor center involving patients diagnosed with gliomas between 2005 and \n2021 who received cranial radiation therapy. Data were collected from the time \nof cranial radiation therapy until last follow-up. Logistic regression analyses \nwere used to evaluate the association of clinical and demographic variables with \nall-cause, ischemic, and hemorrhagic strokes.\nRESULTS: In a retrospective cohort of 930 patients, 910 received radiation \ntherapy (mean age 53.8 years; 40% women) and were included in the final \nanalysis. A total of 91 patients (10.0%) were diagnosed with stroke (73.6% \nischemic; 15.4% with recurrent strokes). The median time to diagnosis of stroke \nafter onset of radiation therapy was 652 days with median time to recurrent \nstroke of 102 days. In a univariable model, Black race (odds ratio [OR] 3.83, \n95% CI 1.94-7.56), radiation necrosis (OR 4.62, 95% CI 2.02-10.55), hypertension \n(OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.23-3.01), hyperlipidemia (OR 5.93, 95% CI 3.61-9.57), and \ndiabetes mellitus (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.28-3.95) were associated with higher odds \nof all-cause stroke. In multivariable analysis, Black race (OR 3.41, 95% CI \n1.59-7.33), radiation necrosis (OR 6.42, 95% CI 2.45-16.79), and hyperlipidemia \n(OR 6.42, 95% CI 3.91-10.57) were significantly associated with increased odds \nof all-cause stroke. Radiation necrosis and hyperlipidemia were associated with \nincreased odds of ischemic stroke. Black race, hyperlipidemia, and younger age \nwere associated with increased odds of hemorrhagic stroke. Compared with \nischemic strokes, hemorrhagic strokes were associated with higher poststroke \ndisability.\nDISCUSSION: In a large, retrospective cohort of adult patients with glioma \ntreated with cranial radiation therapy, 1 in 10 patients were subsequently \ndiagnosed with stroke with 15.4% suffering recurrent strokes. Factors associated \nwith increased odds of stroke included Black race, radiation necrosis, and \nhyperlipidemia and should be validated in future prospective cohorts. Study \nlimitations include the retrospective design, incomplete stroke workups, and \nlack of molecular diagnostics.\n\nDOI: 10.1212/WNL.0000000000213902\nPMID: 40674668 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n42.

In women with prior CeAD, it is \nunclear whether future pregnancies increase the risk of recurrent CeAD, stroke, \nor death.\nOBJECTIVE: To compare the frequency of recurrent CeAD, stroke, or death as a \ncomposite outcome between patients with CeAD who became pregnant vs those who \ndid not.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Long-Term Risk of Recurrent Cervical \nArtery Dissection and Stroke After Pregnancy (LONG-RECAP) study was an \ninternational, multicenter, registry-based, explorative cohort study with data \nfrom May 1, 1990, and April 30, 2023, among patients with CeAD at 33 stroke \ncenters across 9 countries who had at least 6 months of follow-up for whom \ndetailed information was available on absence vs presence of subsequent \npregnancies and the occurrence of outcome events.\nEXPOSURE: Pregnancy after CeAD.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Composite of recurrent CeAD, stroke (any type), and \ndeath (all causes) during follow-up at least 6 months after initial CeAD. \nSecondary outcomes were the components of the composite outcome. Cox \nproportional hazards regression analysis with and without adjustment for age was \nused to examine the association between pregnancy and outcomes.\nRESULTS: Among 1013 female patients with CeAD (median [IQR] age, 42 [35-48] \nyears), 114 (11.3%) became pregnant during a median (IQR) follow-up of 5.3 \n(2.0-11.3) years. The composite outcome occurred in 10 of 114 patients (8.8%), \nincluding 7 patients with recurrent CeADs, 2 with ischemic strokes, and 1 with \nintracerebral hemorrhage, in the pregnancy group compared with 65 of 899 \npatients (7.2%), including 32 with recurrent CeAD, 26 with ischemic strokes, 4 \nwith intracerebral hemorrhages, and 5 deaths (2 patients had 2 outcomes), in the \nnonpregnancy group (unadjusted hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.56-2.08; \nage-adjusted hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.38-1.56). Five of 10 events in the \npregnancy group occurred post partum (4 CeADs and 1 stroke). Age-adjusted hazard \nratios for secondary outcomes were 1.03 (95% CI, 0.43-2.46) for recurrent CeAD, \n0.53 (95% CI, 0.13-2.12) for ischemic stroke, 1.01 (95% CI, 0.11-9.32) for \nintracerebral hemorrhage, and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.03-24.88) for death.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of women with a history of CeAD, \nbecoming pregnant was not associated with an increased risk of recurrent CeAD, \nstroke, or death. These findings may be helpful for individual counseling and \nfamily planning for women with prior CeAD.\n\nDOI: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.21539\nPMID: 40674050 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n43.

Due to limited resources, current \ntherapy levels are insufficient to optimise functional improvement. Robotic \ndevices have potential to augment upper limb stroke rehabilitation, but \nknowledge regarding the optimal device features and intervention parameters is \nlimited. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the \nefficacy of upper limb robotic rehabilitation compared with conventional \nrehabilitation, and to critically explore the device features and programme \nparameters that influence rehabilitation outcomes.\nMETHODS: Six electronic databases were searched for RCTs that compared \ndose-matched robotic versus conventional rehabilitation following stroke, and \nmeasured activity level changes in upper limb outcomes. The efficacy of robotic \ncompared with conventional rehabilitation was evaluated using random-effects \n(I2\u2009\u2265\u200950%) or fixed-effect (I2\u2009<\u200950%) models. A systematic categorization of \nrobotic device features and intervention parameters was conducted to facilitate \nsubgroup analyses and meta-regression, enabling exploration of how these factors \ninfluence rehabilitation outcomes.\nRESULTS: The review included 54 studies, involving 2744 participants. \nMeta-analysis demonstrated that robotic rehabilitation had a small, \nstatistically significant positive effect on upper limb capacity compared with \nconventional rehabilitation (SMD 0.14, 95% CI [0.02, 0.26]), however these gains \nwere not maintained at follow-up (SMD 0.05, 95% CI [-\u00a00.13, 0.24]). No \nsignificant differences were found between robotic and conventional \nrehabilitation for ADL outcomes either post-treatment (SMD 0.04, 95% CI [- 0.05, \n0.13]) or at follow-up (SMD 0.05, 95% CI [-\u00a00.13, 0.24]). Subgroup analyses \nprovided crucial insights into the factors influencing robotic rehabilitation \nefficacy, revealing significant effects of device assistance (p\u2009=\u20090.0046), \njoints mobilized (p\u2009=\u20090.0133), degrees of freedom (p\u2009=\u20090.012), device laterality \n(p\u2009=\u20090.0048), and the number of devices used (p\u2009=\u20090.0001).\nCONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that robotic rehabilitation does not result in \nclinically meaningful improvement in either upper limb capacity or ADL \nperformance. However, this study's novel subgroup analyses highlight specific \ndevice features and intervention parameters that significantly influence \nefficacy. These findings provide critical guidance for the design, \nimplementation, and future research of robotic rehabilitation.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

A mixed method usability test was conducted with 20 \nparticipants who met the criteria. The toolkit was validated in a 12-week \ntwo-arm pilot study involving 80 community-dwelling older patients with stroke. \nTwo groups of participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention or \nthe control group to receive the same content of health education. Intervention \ngroup received health education based on \"digital human\", while control group \nreceived traditional online PDF text health education. The usability test \ncontained Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ), Customer Effort \nScore (CES), Net Promoter Score (NPS), and user interviews. Rate of Participant \n(RP), Rate of Adherence (RA), fall risk perception, object fall risk and quality \nof life were selected as outcome indicators. The corresponding measurement tools \nwere calculation of RP and RA, Fall Risk Perception Scale for community-dwelling \nolder adults (FRPS), Timed Up and Go test (TUG), and the Short Version of the \nStroke Specific Quality of Life scale (SV-SS-QoL).\nRESULTS: Four functional modules of FRP-digital human were determined. 20 \nparticipants completed the usability test. The CES was 3.1, NPS was 4.5 and the \noverall satisfaction of PSSUQ was 72.14%. Six themes were obtained from user \ninterviews. A total of 80 participants completed the pilot study. The RP was \n100% in both intervention group and control group, and significant differences \nwas observed in RA between two groups (P\u2009<\u20090.05). There were statistically \nsignificant differences in FRPS and the SV-SS-QoL between two groups \n(P\u2009<\u20090.001). No statistically significant was observed in TUG between two groups \n(P\u2009=\u20090.996).\nCONCLUSION: FRP-digital human can be accepted by community-dwelling older \npatients with stroke and help improve their fall risk perception and quality of \nlife. Moreover, the design of the WeChat mini program increased its \ngeneralizability to promote more successful health care delivery.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: This study has been registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial \nRegistry: ChiCTR2300068365 (2023-02-16).\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Thus, combining \nreperfusion therapy with neuroprotective treatment offers significant \nadvantages. This study introduces a novel Mg2+ eluting stent by incorporating \nneuroprotective MgSO4 particles into a PLCL (poly (l-lactide-co-\u03b5-caprolactone)) \nsubstrate using 3D printing technology. A novel MgSO4-particle/Mg2+-ions \ncombined-mechanical reinforcement mechanism was introduced. Subsequently, the \nneuroprotective efficacy of the stents was validated through oxygen-glucose \ndeprivation/reoxygenation-injured neuron cells in vitro and via the transient \nmiddle cerebral artery occlusion rat model to emulate human brain \nischemia/reperfusion injury in vivo. The staged-release of Mg2+ is supposed to \nprovide sequential neuroprotection that aligns with the treatment window for \nacute ischemic stroke. This study marks the first development of biodegradable \nneuroprotective brain stents and presents an effective strategy to alleviate \ncerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.\n\n\u00a9 2025.
