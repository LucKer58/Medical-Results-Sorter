The applicability of this staging system in \nchronic kidney disease is not well established.\nMETHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of 2415 participants from CRIC \n(Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort). Individuals were classified into HF stages \nusing 2013 and 2022 American Heart Association/American College of \nCardiology/Heart Failure Society of America HF guidelines using research \nechocardiograms, cardiac biomarkers (troponin T \u226510\u2009ng/L [women], \u226515\u2009ng/L \n[men], pro-B-type natriuretic peptide \u2265125\u2009pg/mL), laboratory measures, and \nhistory. Adjudicated outcomes of HF hospitalizations and all-cause mortality are \nreported.\nRESULTS: In individuals with chronic kidney disease, participants with lower \nestimated glomerular filtration rates were more likely to be reclassified to a \nmore advanced HF stage using the current proposed thresholds of hsTNT \n(high-sensitivity troponin T) and NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic \npeptide). The 2022 guidelines reclassified 55% of 2013 guideline stage A \nparticipants to stage B. HF hospitalization incidence rates differed when \nindividuals were categorized into stage B HF based on elevated hsTNT or \nNT-proBNP (1.7 per 100 person-years) compared with echocardiographic \nabnormalities (2.9 per 100 person-years), whereas death rates were similar \nbetween these groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among individuals with CKD, the addition of elevated hsTNT or \nNT-proBNP to HF staging reclassified nearly 20% of total participants into a \nhigher HF stage. These individuals had similar mortality rates to those \npreviously in higher stages, but they had lower HF hospitalization rates. Those \nwith more advanced chronic kidney disease were more likely to be reclassified.\n\nDOI: 10.1161/JAHA.124.039868\nPMID: 40611482 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n3.

Cardiovascular disease \n(CVD) is a leading cause of non-cancer-related mortality in this population, and \nthis has been attributed to the cardiovascular toxicity of common breast cancer \ntreatments including chemotherapy and radiation as well as shared risk factors \nbetween cancer and CVD. Identifying patients at risk of developing \ntreatment-related cardiotoxicities is crucial to inform clinical decisions \nregarding surveillance, prevention, and management. In this review, we provide a \nbroad overview of the treatment-related cardiotoxicities associated with common \nbreast cancer treatment. We present data on risk-stratification tools for \noncologists, including when to refer to a cardiologist, as well as \nrecommendations for cardiovascular testing tailored to individual treatment \nregimens. Lastly, we review recent trial data on preventive and therapeutic \napproaches to treatment-related cardiotoxicities, and future directions that may \nlead to improved cardiovascular outcomes in this population.\n\nDOI: 10.46883/2025.25921044\nPMID: 40600749 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n4.

These metrics are based on clinical guidelines, \nappropriate use criteria, information and position statements, and expert \nopinion. The document introduces 15 quality metrics that address current gaps in \ncare organized around 4 axes: A) Appropriate indications; B) Patient experience \nand workflow; C) Instrumentation and protocols; and D) Interpretation and \nreporting. With the increasing use of imaging for cardiac amyloid, it is \nimperative that our laboratories maintain a high level of quality to preserve \nthe value that imaging provides to patients. Laboratories should perform imaging \nin appropriately selected patients avoiding low-value imaging. Proper education \nshould be provided to patients prior to performing testing, timely access to \ntesting must be available, and periodic assessment of patient experience and \nsatisfaction should be the norm. Strict adherence to established protocols with \nperiodic assessment of laboratory quality control is essential. Laboratory \nstudies to rule out plasma cell dyscrasia should be performed in all patients \nsuspected of having cardiac amyloidosis. Crucially, interpretation should be \nbased on SPECT rather than planar imaging in all patients. The study report \nshould include sufficient technical details to allow for proper interpretation \nof study findings and its conclusion should be clear and unambiguous to guide \nclinical management. Laboratories can use data derived from these metrics to \nidentify areas of deficiency and introduce quality improvement initiatives, \nwhich will ultimately improve patient outcomes.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

It affects more than 200 million people \nworldwide. PAD is a manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis that is often \nassociated with coronary and cerebrovascular disease, underscoring its crucial \nrole as an indicator of advanced vascular pathology. Despite its strong \nassociation with cardiovascular morbidity, PAD remains underdiagnosed and \nundertreated compared with coronary artery disease (CAD), highlighting a \nsignificant gap in care. Patients with PAD are at increased risk of myocardial \ninfarction (MI), stroke, and limb amputation, so a multidisciplinary approach is \nrequired to reduce adverse outcomes. Identifying at-risk patients through early \nscreening and implementing evidence-based therapeutic strategies is crucial in \ntreating PAD. Modern lipid-lowering agents, dual antithrombotic therapies, and \naggressive risk factor control are essential treatment components. Recent \nadvances, including PCSK9 inhibitors and novel antiplatelet agents, have shown \npromise for improving cardiovascular and limb-related outcomes, although further \nvalidation is needed. Given the systemic nature of atherosclerosis, managing PAD \nshould be a cornerstone of cardiovascular care, requiring individualised \ntreatment plans. Increasing awareness and understanding of PAD is critical to \nbridging gaps in diagnosis and treatment to improve the overall prognosis and \nquality of life of patients with this debilitating disease. This work aims to \nenhance practical approaches to PAD by providing comprehensive insights into its \nmanagement and offering a foundation for exploring innovative future treatment \noptions.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Italian Federation of Cardiology - I.F.C.

It also provides an overview of the main \ndegrees and postgraduate training programs for specialization in cardiology \nmanagement in major Western countries.\nBACKGROUND: The increasing complexity of the healthcare sector requires an \nevolution in nursing education and clinical competencies to effectively manage \ncare in complex and interdisciplinary contexts such as cardiology settings.\nMETHODS: This scoping review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute framework. The \nPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for \nScoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) was used to ensure rigorous and transparent \nreporting.\nRESULTS: Among the 647 records analyzed, 15 were included in this review. In the \ncardiology setting, the APN plays a critical role in clinical care, education, \nand research, providing both direct and indirect support to patients at all \nstages, across outpatient and inpatient settings. Thanks to the advanced skills \nacquired through specific paths, it also acts as a link between the healthcare \nteam and patients, improving the provision of care through personalized and \ncoordinated actions and promoting continuous training and research in the field.\nCONCLUSIONS: APN enhances cardiac care by offering in-depth clinical \nassessments, education, and support throughout the treatment process. However, \nthe lack of standardized regulatory frameworks in some countries limits the \nautonomy of cardiology APNs within the healthcare system, compromising their \nability to address unmet healthcare needs and collaborate internationally.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

Methods: This is a cross-sectional study utilized \nconvenience sampling. In December 2023, a self-designed questionnaire was \ndistributed to 7 980 clinical physicians, including 930 cardiologists. The \nsurvey collected demographic information, including work city (categorized as \nfirst-tier, new first-tier, second-tier, third-tier, and fourth-tier and below), \nhospital level, professional title, and department. And the awareness of LLM, \nand their application demands in clinical decision-making support, information \nfiltering, and scientific research work were also collected. Differences in \nawareness and application requirements across geographic regions, hospital \ntiers, professional ranks, and medical departments were analyzed. Besides, \nspecific demands of cardiovascular specialists were further examined. Results: \nAmong the 7 980 clinical physicians, the awareness rate of LLM was 76.3% (6 \n088/7 980), and the utilization rate was 11.8% (942/7 980). For the 930 \ncardiologists, the awareness rate was 78.5% (730/930) and the utilization rate \nwas 11.4% (106/930). Significant differences in awareness and utilization rates \nwere observed across city tiers, hospital grades, and departments (all P<0.05). \nNo significant difference was found among professional titles (P=0.053). Among \nthe 6 088 physicians aware of LLM, demand rates for clinical information \nfiltering, clinical decision support, and research assistance were 87.3% (5 \n312/6 088), 78.4% (4 774/6 088), and 75.8% (4 616/6 088), respectively. For the \n730 cardiologists aware of LLM, these rates were 91.0% (664/730), 79.2% \n(578/730), and 75.9% (554/730), respectively. Significant differences in demands \nfor clinical information filtering and research assistance were observed across \ncity tiers, hospital grades, professional titles, and departments (all P<0.05), \nwhile no significant difference was noted for decision support demands across \nhospital grades (P=0.085). In clinical information screening and acquisition, \ncardiologists from different city tiers exhibited statistically significant \ndifferences in the demand for literature interpretation. Similarly, variations \nin the demand for conference summaries, expert biographies, healthcare policies, \nand social news were noted among cardiologists with different professional \ntitles, while disparities in patient education and science popularization needs \nwere identified across city tiers and hospital grades (all P<0.05). In clinical \ndecision-making support, cardiologists from diverse city tiers and professional \ntitles demonstrated distinct differences in guideline and consensus inquiries, \nand those from various city tiers showed varied demands for pharmaceutical and \nmedical device-related content (all P<0.05). For research support, cardiologists \nacross city tiers and professional titles exhibited statistically significant \ndifferences in trial protocol design requirements, while those from varying city \ntiers differed in literature search/analysis and research application \nprocedures. Additionally, physicians from different hospital grades displayed \ndivergent needs for data collection (all P<0.05). Conclusions: The adoption of \nLLM is significantly influenced by regional disparities, institutional \nresources, and professional backgrounds. Implementing targeted interventions, \nsuch as enhancing technical training, optimizing LLM functionalities, and \nimproving accessibility across diverse healthcare settings, could encourage \nwidespread integration of LLM into clinical practice.

However, multiple \nprocedures lead to prolonged exposure to ionizing radiation (IR), raising \nconcerns for secondary long-term health issues.\nPURPOSE: This study aimed to establish local dose reference levels (LDRLs) for a \nNational Reference Center for Congenital Cardiopathies (NRCCC) in Portugal. \nAdditionally, it estimated effective and organ doses in paediatric patients \nundergoing coronary angiographies (CAs) using measurements and Monte Carlo \nsimulations.\nMETHODS: LDRLs were determined through statistical analysis of patient registry \ndata from 120 patients recorded between 2022 and 2023. For effective dose \nestimation, personal dose equivalent values Hp(10) were measured with an \nanthropomorphic phantom (CIRS ATOM 705) and Raysafe dosimeters, used to validate \nMonte Carlo (MC) simulations, which were then employed with rescaled paediatric \nvoxel phantoms (GsF Baby and Child), to estimate effective doses and dose \nconversion coefficients (DCCs) for representative patient anatomies across \ndifferent age and weight groups.\nRESULTS: LDRLs for coronary angiographies at the NRCCC showed significant dose \nvariability, indicating dose optimization opportunities. Monte Carlo simulations \nallowed for organ dose and effective dose calculations. Dose Conversion \nCoefficients were 1.107, 0.882, 0.719, and 0.524\u00a0mSv/Gy\u00b7cm2 for newborn, \n1\u00a0year-old, 5\u00a0year-old and 10\u00a0year-old groups respectively. A strong linear \ncorrelation between effective dose and air-kerma area product (KAP) was \nobserved.\nCONCLUSIONS: The study highlights the strong correlation between effective dose \nand KAP, offering a practical framework for estimating patient doses and \nenhancing radiation safety protocols in clinical practice.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica e Sanitaria.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have shown \npromise in enhancing survival, but they are associated with immune-related \nadverse events, including potentially life-threatening myocarditis. Moreover, \nICI-induced myocarditis can be asymptomatic, necessitating early diagnosis. \nSpecific risk factors and biomarkers for esophageal cancer remain poorly \ncharacterized.\nAIM: To investigate the determinants of ICI-associated asymptomatic myocarditis \nin patients with esophageal cancer and explore potential early biomarkers.\nMETHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 202 cancer patients who \nreceived treatment at Shanxi Province Cancer Hospital from July 2019 to July \n2024.\nRESULTS: Older age, male gender, and elevated creatine kinase isoenzymes (CK-MB) \nand CK levels were found to be significant risk factors for asymptomatic \nmyocarditis. The myocarditis occurrence group had higher CK-MB (3.05 ng/mL vs \n5.02 ng/mL; P < 0.001) and CK levels (187.29 U/L vs 212.25 U/L; P = 0.005), and \nthe predictive value of age, gender, CK, and CK-MB was low [are under the \nreceiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.579-0.608]. However, their \ncombination in a predictive model showed improved diagnostic capability, with an \nAUC of 0.808.\nCONCLUSION: Age, gender, and cardiac biomarker levels considerably contribute to \nthe risk of ICI-related myocarditis in patients with esophageal cancer. The \nintegration of these factors into a predictive model enhances early diagnosis, \nfacilitating personalized risk management.\n\n\u00a9The Author(s) 2025.

So this study aimed to \nsystematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of cryoballoon (CB) and \nradiofrequency (RF) ablation in the treatment of persistent AF.\nMETHODS: We searched the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library databases for \nstudies comparing the efficacy and safety between CB and RF ablation for \npersistent AF. All included studies met our inclusion criteria.\nRESULTS: A total of 11 studies, 2551 patients were enrolled in this study, \nincluding 1256 patients in CB group and 1295 patients in RF group. Meta-analysis \nresults showed that the freedom from atrial tachyarrhythmia (ATA) recurrence was \nsimilar between the CB and RF groups (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.18, I2 16%). The \nresults of repeated ablation events in the two groups were similar (OR 0.85, 95% \nCI 0.64 to 1.12, I245%), while the operative time in the CB group was shorter \nthan that in the RF group (mean reduction 45.27\u00a0min, 95% CI 61.34 to 29.20\u00a0min, \nI2 95%). There was no significant difference in fluoroscopy time between the two \ngroups (mean difference 2.12\u00a0min, 95% CI 7.83 to 12.07\u00a0min, I2 99%). The \nincidence of total complications was similar between the two groups (OR 1.08, \n95% CI 0.74 to 1.58, I2 0%), but phrenic nerve palsy (PNP) was more likely to \noccur in the CB group (OR 4.84, 95% CI 1.84 to 12.71, I2 0%). The incidence of \npericardial tamponade was not statistically different between the two groups (OR \n0.72, 95% CI 00.32 to 1.58, I2 0%).\nCONCLUSIONS: CB can be used as an alternative therapy to RF for persistent AF, \nboth of which have considerable efficacy and safety. CB can significantly reduce \nthe operation time with the probability of high PNP.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Patients were \ndivided into Group A (cases with X monosomy, 45, X) and Group B (cases with \nother X chromosomal abnormalities, including mosaicism and structural \nanomalies). The clinical, laboratory, and imaging features were compared between \nthe two groups.\nRESULTS: Among the 87 patients, 43 (49.43%) were diagnosed with X monosomy, \nwhereas 44 (50.57%) exhibited other X chromosomal abnormalities, including 2 \ncases (2.29%) with Y chromosome material. Group A exhibited significantly higher \nrates of facial dysmorphism (95.35% versus 59.09%, P\u2009<\u20090.001), cardiovascular \nanomalies (41.86% versus 18.18%, P\u2009=\u20090.016), spinal deformities (58.14% versus \n34.09%, P\u2009=\u20090.024), renal abnormalities (27.91% versus 4.55%, P\u2009=\u20090.003), and \nelevated fasting insulin levels (median 9.2 versus 6.7 mIU/mL, P\u2009=\u20090.007) \ncompared to Group B.\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with transitional TS exhibit diverse karyotypes, with X \nmonosomy may be associated with more severe phenotypes. Karyotype evaluation may \nhelp inform individualized monitoring priorities, particularly for \ncardiovascular, renal, and metabolic comorbidities. These findings support \nindividualized clinical management and multidisciplinary transitional care \ninformed by karyotype.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

However, sex is a \ncomplex trait with anatomic, physiologic, and metabolic attributes that are not \neasily summarized in this manner [1]. We propose a continuous representation of \nsex, the ECG Sex Index (ESI), derived via artificial intelligence analyses of \nelectrocardiograms (ECG-AI).We used an ECG repository at Wake Forest Baptist \nHealth (Winston-Salem, NC) to develop a convolutional neural network-based \nECG-AI model to detect sex from standard 12-lead ECGs. We utilized a \nrank-ordered transformation of the outcomes of ECG-AI to create the ESI. We also \ncreated a sex discordance index (SDI) from the ESI and assessed its utility in \n1-year risk prediction for all-cause mortality, heart failure, and kidney \nfailure.The Wake Forest cohort included 3,573,844 ECGs and electronic health \nrecord data from 754,761 patients; 75% were White, 17% were Black, and 51% were \nfemale, with a mean age (SD) of 61 (17) years. The PhysioNet external validation \ncohort included 45,152 ECGs from 10,646 patients from two hospitals in China. \nThe PhysioNet cohort was 100% Asian, 43.6% female, and had a mean age (SD) of 59 \n(20) years. ECG-AI provided a holdout area under the curve of 0.95 and an \nexternal validation area under the curve of 0.92. Lower ESI scores in males and \nhigher ESI scores in females were associated with a greater risk for clinical \noutcomes. The ESI and SDI demonstrated comparable accuracy to binary sex in \nlogistic regression analyses and outperformed binary sex in predicting clinical \noutcomes, highlighting their value as predictors in risk calculators for \nall-cause mortality, heart failure, and kidney failure.\n\nPlain Language Summary: An individual\u2019s sex is typically classified as male or \nfemale at birth based on the presence of either a penis or a clitoris. However, \nthere are many common features of male and female individuals at the metabolic \nand cellular levels. These commonalities are neglected in disease risk \nprediction models when an individual is labeled as male or female. This study \nproposes a novel, nonbinary representation of sex to be used in disease risk \nprediction models. Our novel nonbinary variable is derived via artificial \nintelligence applied to electrocardiographic data. It predicts all-cause \nmortality, heart failure, and kidney failure better than a binary sex variable.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

We aimed to evaluate stroke and major \nbleeding risk in patients with atrial fibrillation using rivaroxaban, apixaban, \ndabigatran and the effects of using antiplatelet, atorvastatin and proton pump \ninhibitor (PPI) on development of stroke.\nMETHODS: Patients who were administered rivaroxaban, dabigatran or apixaban for \natrial fibrillation between June 2014 and December 2020 were retrospectively \nanalysed. Demographic data, CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores, HAS-BLED scores, \nantiplatelet, proton pump inhibitor, atorvastatin medications were evaluated. \nFurthermore, we evaluated the risk of major bleeding and stroke during \ntreatment.\nRESULTS: We investigated 162 patients using dabigatran, 255 patients using \nrivaroxaban and 104 patients using apixaban. No significant difference was \nobserved between the groups in terms of CHA2DS2-VASc scores and the use of \natorvastatin, proton pump inhibitor and antiplatelet. HAS-BLED scores before \nDOACs treatment were statistically significantly higher in the apixaban group \ncompared to rivaroxaban and dabigatran groups (p\u2009=\u20090.038); we found no \ndifference between the study groups in terms of major bleeding (p\u2009=\u20090.528) and \nstroke risk (p\u2009=\u20090.498). The use of antiplatelet, proton pump inhibitor and \natorvastatin did not have a significant effect on stroke risk (p\u2009=\u20090.533, \np\u2009=\u20090.169 and p\u2009=\u20090.949).\nCONCLUSION: Rivaroxaban, dabigatran and apixaban have similar safety and \nefficacy for stroke prophylaxis.

We \nhypothesize that higher AVF flow is associated with adverse cardiovascular \noutcomes including an increased incidence of heart failure. We sought to clarify \nthis relationship as understanding this association is crucial for improving \npatient care.\nMETHODS: A comprehensive search of the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases \nwas used to identify observational studies and randomized controlled trials \nreporting an effect of AVF flow on cardiac outcomes (clinical, \nechocardiographic, and biomarker). Due to study heterogeneity, meta-analysis was \nnot feasible. Synthesis without meta-analysis (SWiM) was performed using vote \ncounting of direction of effect as the primary outcome.\nRESULTS: Higher AVF flow rates were consistently associated with increased \nincidence of HF and worsening HF symptoms. Cardiac imaging revealed left \nventricular dilation and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction in patients \nwith high-flow AVFs. Elevated biomarkers, such as natriuretic peptides, \ncorroborated the adverse cardiovascular effects of high AVF flow.\nCONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and synthesis without meta-analysis showed a \npositive relationship between AVF flow and clinical, echocardiographic, and \nbiomarker cardiovascular outcomes. The methodological heterogeneity of studies \nhighlights the need for well-designed prospective research with standardised \ndefinitions of high flow AVFs and measures for reporting of cardiovascular \noutcomes.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Thus, opportunistic screening may be \na cost-effective way to assess osteoporosis in high-risk populations.\nBACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is an underdiagnosed condition associated with \nfractures and frailty, but may be detected in routine computed tomography (CT) \nscans.\nMETHODS: Volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) was measured in clinical routine \nthoraco-abdominal CT scans of 207 patients for planning of transcatheter aortic \nvalve replacement (TAVR) using an artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithm.\nRESULTS: 43% of patients had osteoporosis (vBMD\u2009<\u200980 mg/cm3 L1-L3) and were \nelderly (83.0 {interquartile range [IQR]: 78.0-85.5} vs. 79.0 {IQR: 71.8-84.0} \nyears, p\u2009<\u20090.001), more often female (55.1 vs. 28.8%, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and had a \nhigher Society of Thoracic Surgeon's score for mortality (3.0 {IQR:1.8-4.6} vs. \n2.1 {IQR: 1.4-3.2}%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). In addition to lumbar vBMD (58.2\u2009\u00b1\u200914.7 vs. \n106\u2009\u00b1\u200921.4 mg/cm3, p\u2009<\u20090.001), thoracic vBMD (79.5\u2009\u00b1\u200917.9 vs. 127.4\u2009\u00b1\u200926.0 \nmg/cm3, p\u2009<\u20090.001) was also significantly reduced in these patients and showed \nhigh diagnostic accuracy for osteoporosis\u00a0assessment (area under curve: 0.96, \np\u2009<\u20090.001). Osteoporotic patients were significantly more often at risk for \nfalls (40.4 vs. 22.9%, p\u2009=\u20090.007) and required help in activities of daily life \n(ADL) more frequently (48.3 vs. 33.1%, p\u2009=\u20090.026), while direct-to-home \ndischarges were fewer (88.8 vs. 96.6%, p\u2009=\u20090.026). In-hospital bleeding \ncomplications (3.4 vs. 5.1%), stroke (1.1 vs. 2.5%), and death (1.1 vs. 0.8%) \nwere equally low, while in-hospital device success was equally high (94.4 vs. \n94.9%, p\u2009>\u20090.05 for all comparisons). However, one-year probability of survival \nwas significantly lower (84.0 vs. 98.2%, log-rank p\u2009<\u20090.01).\nCONCLUSION: Applying an AI-based algorithm to TAVR planning CT scans can reveal \na high rate of 43% patients having osteoporosis. Osteoporosis may represent a \nmarker related to frailty and worsened outcome in TAVR patients.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

This review summarizes the clinical presentation, diagnostic \nchallenges, and therapeutic strategies for cardiac involvement in BS.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Advanced imaging techniques have revealed subclinical cardiac \ninvolvement in BS. Myocardial dysfunction and fibrosis contribute to heart \nfailure and arrhythmias, while intracardiac thrombi often coexist with pulmonary \nartery involvement. Coronary artery vasculitis and aneurysms may mimic \natherosclerotic disease, complicating diagnosis. Biologic therapies, including \nTNF-\u03b1 inhibitors, show promise in refractory cases. Early diagnosis and \nimmunosuppressive therapy are crucial. A multidisciplinary approach is essential \nto managing cardiac complications and optimizing patient outcomes. Future \nresearch should refine screening protocols and explore targeted immunotherapies \nfor BS-related cardiovascular disease.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

SCD risk stratification is a controversial topic surrounded by debate, \nsince it is not easy to determine the appropriate timing for implanting an \nautomatic defibrillator. Given that arrhythmic events are associated with \nmyocardial scars, SCD stratification should go beyond the assessment of systolic \nfunction. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a fundamental role \nsince it enables the non-invasive characterisation of macroscopic and \ninterstitial myocardial fibrosis, revealing the pattern and extent. This article \nreviews the role of cardiac MRI in SCD risk prediction.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 SERAM. Published by Elsevier Espa\u00f1a, S.L.U.

The usability engineering process is needed to fulfill \nuser interface design requirements as part of product development at True Dose \nkit. Methods: The study employed a convergent parallel design, integrating \nquantitative and qualitative data. Twenty-five participants, recruited through \nconvenience sampling, used the True Dose kit to perform capillary blood \nself-sampling. Quantitative data were collected using three key performance \nmetrics-collection of sufficient blood volume, absence of air bubbles, and \nduration of the self-sampling process-along with two questionnaires, the System \nUsability Scale (SUS) and the Test Feedback Questionnaire (TFQ), to \ncomprehensively assess user performance and experience. In contrast, qualitative \ndata were obtained from interviews and free-text responses. The integration of \nfindings highlighted areas of convergence and divergence between the \nquantitative and qualitative data. Results: The overall SUS score was 82.70, \nindicating high usability. However, participants reported challenges with the \ncomplexity of instructions and stress associated with blood flow management. \nQualitative insights revealed a preference for simplified visual guidance and \nhighlighted the need for precise feedback mechanisms to ensure the correct \nexecution of sampling steps. Despite these challenges, 92% of participants \ncollected the required blood sample, with a median self-sampling duration of \n10.42\u2009min. Conclusion: The True Dose kit demonstrates high usability potential, \nbut improvements in instructional design and stress management are needed to \nenhance user experience and ensure consistent performance.

To interrogate how \nmechanical stiffness of the ECM affects microvascular remodeling, we developed a \nbioactive poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogel model with tunable \nstiffness that permits microvascular sprouting.\nMETHODS: Lung explants harvested from healthy and fibrotic mice were cultured \nex\u00a0vivo on PEGDA hydrogels for 7\u2009days. Capillary sprouting from lung segments \nwas evaluated via imaging and secreted angiogenic markers.\nRESULTS: Healthy lung explants had decreased sprout formation and length on \nstiffer hydrogels. The sprouts from fibrotic lung explants, however, were not \nimpacted by hydrogel stiffness. This difference was associated with higher \nexpression of angiogenic markers and matrix remodeling enzymes in the fibrotic \nlung explants.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a compensation in vasculature derived from \nfibrotic tissue to matrix mechanics in promoting angiogenic sprouting.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

Kidney size is a commonly used morphological parameter in \nrenal assessment; however, it lacks sensitivity for early disease detection. \nCortical parameters, particularly cortical thickness, correlate more strongly \nwith early renal disease, as the cortex plays a key role in filtration and is \nhighly vulnerable to injury. Rabbits, widely kept as pets, have distinct renal \nanatomy and are prone to kidney diseases, making them a relevant model for renal \nstudies. Previous studies have shown that ultrasonography can effectively \nmeasure kidney size in rabbits, correlating with body weight.\nOBJECTIVES: This study aimed to establish a normative ratio of renal cortical \nthickness to the internal diameter of the abdominal aorta in healthy rabbits.\nMETHODS: Sixty healthy adult male mixed-breed rabbits underwent ultrasonographic \nevaluation. Renal cortical thickness and abdominal aortic diameter were \nmeasured, ensuring that only rabbits without clinical or ultrasonographic signs \nof kidney disease were included.\nRESULTS: Pearson correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between \nrenal cortical thickness, aortic diameter and body weight. However, the ratio of \nrenal cortical thickness to aortic diameter remained independent of body weight.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study established a normative reference range for renal \ncortical thickness relative to aortic diameter in rabbits, providing a novel \ndiagnostic parameter for renal assessment. The confidence intervals for the \nratio were 0.82 (0.77-0.87) to 1.35 (1.30-1.40) for the left kidney and 0.79 \n(0.74-0.84) to 1.33 (1.27-1.38) for the right kidney, marking the first report \nof this method in the literature.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

However, TEVAR-specific complications occasionally \nnecessitate open repair. In such cases, especially in patients with complex \naortic arch pathology, the choice of surgical approach is critical. In this \ncase, considering the unique background of cold agglutinin disease, we opted for \nan anterolateral partial sternotomy approach. This approach provided excellent \nexposure for aortic manipulation and allowed preservation of the existing bypass \ngrafts, contributing to a successful outcome. We believe that this technique can \nbe effectively applied in similar complex cases requiring open repair after \ndebranching TEVAR.\n\nPMID: 40676743 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n28.

Deep inhalation has been \nshown to enhance the variability of the internal jugular vein (IJV). In this \nstudy, we aim to investigate the relationship between internal jugular vein \nvariability (IJVV) during deep inhalation and the extent of blood pressure \ndecrease during propofol induction, as well as the potential of utilizing IJVV \nas a guide for pre-anesthesia fluid resuscitation.\nMETHODS: Before general anesthesia induction, bedside ultrasonic measurement was \nperformed to evaluate the maximum diameter (IJVmax-D) and minimum diameter \n(IJVmin-D) of the IJV and the maximum cross-sectional area (IJVmax-A) and \nminimum cross-sectional area (IJVmin-A), and then calculated the IJV diameter \nvariability (IJVV-D) and IJV area variability (IJVV-A). A receiver operating \ncharacteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the diagnostic value of IJVV-D \nand IJVV-A for predicting propofol induced hypotension (blood pressure \ndecreased\u2009\u2265\u200920%) and calculate the cut-off value. The following prospective \nrandomized controlled trial aimed to compare the incidence of anesthesia-induced \nhypotension between the IJVV-D or IJVV-A guided fluid administration (Group A) \nand the standard fluid administration group (Group B) in patients with the \nvariability value\u2009>\u2009optimal cut-off value. The occurrence rate of hypotension \nduring the propofol induction period was observed and compared between the two \ngroups.\nRESULTS: A total of 60 patients were included in the final analysis. A \nsignificant strong correlation exists between IJVV-A and the degree of blood \npressure decrease during deep inhalation (r\u2009=\u20090.858, p\u2009<\u20090.001). The AUC of \nIJVV-A was 0.900 (95% CI 0.821-0.979, p\u2009<\u20090.001) with a cut-off value of 23.42% \n(sensitivity: 81.5%, specificity: 84.8%). At the same time, a total of 87 \npatients with IJVV-A\u2009>\u200923.42% during deep inhalation were included in the data \nanalysis. The incidence of hypotension in Group A was 26.8%, compared to 63.0% \nin Group B, revealing a statistically significant difference (P\u2009<\u20090.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: A significant relationship was observed between IJVV levels during \ndeep inhalation and the blood pressure decline following propofol induction. \nAdministering IJVV-A guided fluid infusion can significantly reduce \npropofol-induced hypotension by keeping the IJVV-A less than 23.42% during deep \ninspiration.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Successfully registered on Clinicaltrials.gov on November 1, \n2023 (NCT06112769) and on August 1, 2024 (NCT06641505).\n\n\u00a9 2025.

The distal radial artery (dRA) \napproach has been proposed as a potential alternative to the conventional radial \nartery (RA) approach. This is the first randomized clinical trial to assess the \ncomparative efficacy and reliability of dRA versus RA catheterization by \nexamining first-attempt success rates and the stability of arterial pressure \nwaveforms in critically ill ICU patients.\nMETHODS: This randomized controlled trial enrolled 200 critically ill patients \nrequiring arterial catheterization, assigning them to either dRA (n\u2009=\u2009100) or \nconventional RA (n\u2009=\u2009100) groups. All procedures utilized a standard 20-gauge \npolyurethane peripheral intravenous catheter. Co-primary outcomes included \nfirst-attempt success rate and frequency of arterial pressure waveform loss \nduring the initial 72-h period. Secondary outcomes included catheterization \ntime, complications during insertion and management, hemostasis time, and \ncatheter duration. Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple testing \n(\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.025).\nRESULTS: First-attempt success rates were comparable between dRA and RA groups \n(86% vs. 84%, P\u2009=\u20090.688). The dRA group experienced significantly fewer arterial \npressure waveform losses across all three days (Day 1: 1.0 [0.0, 2.0] vs. 2.0 \n[1.0, 2.0]; Day 2: 1.0 [0.0, 1.0] vs. 2.0 [1.0, 2.0]; Day 3: 0.0 [0.0, 1.0] vs. \n1.0 [1.0, 2.0]; all P\u2009<\u20090.001). Both groups achieved 100% procedural success \nwith no site crossovers. Arterial catheterization time was longer in the dRA \ngroup (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Complication rates during catheterization, management, and \nafter removal were similar between groups. Hemostasis time was significantly \nshorter in the dRA group (2.6\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5\u00a0min vs. 4.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9\u00a0min, P\u2009<\u20090.001). Catheter \nduration was similar between groups (76.6\u2009\u00b1\u200916.7 vs. 77.4\u2009\u00b1\u200916.4\u00a0h, P\u2009=\u20090.724).\nCONCLUSIONS: While first-attempt success rates were similar, the dRA approach \noffered greater arterial pressure waveform stability and shorter hemostasis time \nthan the conventional RA approach, without increasing complications. Thus, dRA \nmay be a preferable option for arterial catheterization in critically ill \npatients.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered in the Chinese Clinical Trials \nRegistry (registration number: ChiCTR2400086284, registration date: 27/06/2024).\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Curiously, a bimodal size distribution \nemerged in this group. Physiological traits were similar between groups apart \nfrom higher standard metabolic rates in the 4\u00a0\u00b0C incubated fish. Each group had \ndistinct heart morphologies where fish with a slower growth history resembled \nwild-phenotypes while homozygous fish had the most deviating hearts. Proportions \nof vaterite deposition in otoliths showed high individual variation and did not \ndiffer between groups. Lower coefficients of variation within groups were found \nwhen compared to outbred fish, but this was not consistent for all traits \nassessed. As such, substantial phenotypic variation in physiology and morphology \nwas still observed in isogenic Atlantic salmon, which can be ascribed to random \nenvironmental factors.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

This study \nproposes a silicon nanocolumn capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer \n(snCMUT) array for real-time wearable ultrasound imaging in disposable patches. \nUsing a lead-free design, snCMUT incorporates silicon nanocolumns to address \nexisting issues and achieves high transmission efficiency (220\u2009kPa/V), \nflexibility, and low power consumption. The specialized structure of snCMUT \nenhances displacement efficiency, enabling high-resolution imaging while \nmaintaining a thin, flexible form factor (~900\u2009\u03bcm). Phantom imaging demonstrates \nits superior performance, with high axial and lateral resolutions (0.52 and \n0.55\u2009mm) and depth penetration (~70\u2009mm) at low voltage (8.9 VPP). Upon \nsuccessful application to monitor both sides of the human carotid arteries, \nsnCMUT offers clear ultrasound images and continuous blood pressure waveform \nmonitoring. This proposed innovation presents significant potential for \ncontinuous medical imaging and cardiovascular health assessment, addressing \nenvironmental concerns and reducing manufacturing costs (<$20).\n\n\u00a9 2025.

In the setting of primary brain tumors, CSF has been implicated in \ntumor pathogenesis by serving as both a reservoir and vehicle for factors which \nmay support tumor progression, therefore contributing to the tumor \nmicroenvironment. Pathological manifestations of CSF in the setting of brain \ntumors include hydrocephalus due to tumor obstruction of CSF pathways, CSF \nseeding and leptomeningeal metastasis, and transependymal flow. CSF also has \nroles as a reservoir for biomarkers important in brain tumor detection and as a \nsite for direct delivery of therapeutic agents to bypass the blood brain \nbarrier. Despite the intimate association between CSF and brain tumors, few \nstudies have investigated mechanisms of local and global alterations of fluid \nflow in the setting of glioma, the most common malignant primary brain tumor in \nthe central nervous system. Here, we provide an overview of recent advances in \nour understanding of the roles, implications, regulations, and \ndiagnostic/therapeutic implications of CSF in glioma and how they may be \nleveraged for research and clinical application.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

Effective treatment with ablation therapy requires a precise \nguidance system. Non-linear optical microscopy techniques, such as second \nharmonic generation (SHG) and two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF), are \npromising candidates for a high-resolution alternative to conventional \nelectrical mapping for assessing infarcted cardiac tissue. Here, we apply SHG \nand TPEF with a resolution advantage over commonly used electrical mapping \ntechniques to assess ex-vivo sheep heart infarction. Analyzing conventional and \nradiomic features allows for quantitative characterization of scar tissue.

The fatty acid translocase CD36 (CD36) plays a \npivotal role in regulating lipid homeostasis and mitochondrial metabolism. Here, \nwe demonstrate that inhibiting the palmitoylation of CD36 and the resulting \nalteration in its subcellular localization alleviates lipid metabolism disorders \nand mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiomyocytes of male mice post-MI. \nMechanistically, the inhibition of CD36 palmitoylation enhances cardiac function \nthrough a dual mechanism: first, by alleviating fatty acid overload mediated by \nplasma membrane CD36, thereby restoring lipid metabolic balance; second, by \naugmenting the activity of the mitochondrial CD36-PGAM5 signaling axis and \nmodulating Fundc1 and Drp1 Dephosphorylation, which subsequently improves \nmitophagy efficiency. Overall, our study highlights the significant role of CD36 \npalmitoylation in preserving heart function by regulating downstream metabolic \nsignaling pathways, suggesting that targeting CD36 palmitoylation could be a \npromising therapeutic strategy for MI.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

CSNS was applied daily for \n10\u2009min over 3\u2009days. Cardiac, renal, and inflammatory parameters characterized \nthe CRS1 and the electroceutical effects of CSNS.\nRESULTS: CSNS reduced the ischemic zone compared to the AMI group not exposed to \nCSNS (32.7%\u2009\u00b1\u20092.2% vs. 8.0%\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8%). Heart rate (bpm) was increased in the AMI \ngroup, showing 440\u2009\u00b1\u20097.6 at 48\u2009h and 428\u2009\u00b1\u20091.0 at 60\u2009h post-AMI. Additionally, \narterial pressure (mmHg) was increased in the AMI group at 48\u2009h, as follows: \nmean: 98\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7, diastolic: 89\u2009\u00b1\u20092.1, and systolic: 122\u2009\u00b1\u20095.3. In contrast, the \nCSNS + AMI group showed significant reductions of these parameters: mean: \n79\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0, diastolic, 66\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7, and systolic: 99\u2009\u00b1\u20092.7. Renal injury was \nconfirmed by increased apoptosis in the AMI group. A significant increase in \nTNF-\u03b1 was observed in both heart and kidneys (pg/mg of tissue) in the AMI group \nand reduced IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 levels in the CSNS + AMI group, indicating an \nattenuation of the inflammatory responses by CSNS.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates early cardiac and renal dysfunction in CRS1 \nfollowing AMI, associated with elevated inflammatory markers (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and \nIL-1\u03b2) and renal apoptosis. Therefore, CSNS appears to be a promising \nelectroceutical approach for CRS1. Besides, on the basis of previous studies \nfrom our laboratory, CSNS involves stimulation of the baroreflex, activating the \nparasympathetic and inhibiting the sympathetic nervous system.\n\n\u00a9 2025 Scandinavian Physiological Society.

This study aimed to evaluate its diagnostic accuracy in a \nhigh-volume ED setting in T\u00fcrkiye.\nMETHODS: This single-center retrospective cohort study was conducted at Marmara \nUniversity Pendik Training and Research Hospital, T\u00fcrkiye, from September 1 to \nDecember 31, 2022. Adults presenting with acute chest discomfort and undergoing \nhs-cTnT testing per the ESC 0/1-hour algorithm were included. Patients with \nST-segment elevation, missing data, pregnancy, or those discharged against \nmedical advice were excluded. The primary outcome was NSTEMI diagnosis; the \nsecondary outcome was major adverse cardiac events (MACE) within 30\u2009days.\nRESULTS: Of 3,529 eligible patients, 3,216 were included. The mean age of the \npatients was 53.9\u2009\u00b1\u200916.4\u2009years, and 58.3% were male. NSTEMI was diagnosed in 319 \npatients (9.9%). According to the ESC algorithm, 54.4% of patients were \nclassified as \"rule-out,\" 31.3% as \"observe,\" and 12.3% as \"rule-in.\" The \nsensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) for NSTEMI in the \"rule-out\" \ngroup were both 100%. In the \"rule-in\" group, the specificity was 91.16%, and \nthe positive predictive value (PPV) was 59.14%. MACE occurred in 13.6% (436 \npatients) within 30\u2009days: 0.7% in the \"rule-out\" group, 13.9% in the \"observe\" \ngroup, and 67.0% in the \"rule-in\" group.\nCONCLUSIONS: The ESC 0/1-hour algorithm is highly effective for ruling out \nNSTEMI in T\u00fcrkiye, demonstrating excellent sensitivity and NPV. While it \nfacilitates early discharge of low-risk patients, enhancements are needed for \nrisk stratification in intermediate-risk groups. Its implementation could \noptimize ED resource utilization and improve clinical outcomes.\nCLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

The modifiable risk factors are very important not only \nfor its prevention, but also for its long-term management. Adherence to \nself-care plays a very important part in improving outcomes following MI. \nHowever, after MI, patient adherence declines over time. The Theory of Planned \nBehavior (TPB) is a socio-psychological theory that can be a model to develop \nfocused interventions which will improve self-care practices.\nMETHODS: This quasi-experimental study was conducted on 140 post-MI patients in \nFasa City, Iran (2023-2024). They were randomly allocated to the intervention \n(70) or control (70) group. Participants in the intervention group received \na\u200210-session education program based on the TPB content related to self-care \ncomponents. The control group only received standard care. Validated scales \nassessed self-care behavior,\u2002TPB constructs (attitude, subjective norms, \nperceived behavioral control), lifestyle modification and behavioral intention \nat baseline and 4-month follow-up.\nRESULTS: There was no significant difference between both groups in terms of \ndemographic and baseline variables and TPB domains (p\u2009>\u20090.05). However, at four \nmonths following the intervention, the intervention group showed a significant \nimprovement in all evaluated variables compared to the control group \n(p\u2009<\u20090.001).\nCONCLUSION: The TPB-based educational intervention can meaningfully improve the \nself-care behavior of MI patients. Future work should assess the sustainability \nover time of these changes, and the feasibility of using digital health \ntechnology to support enhanced patient compliance.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

However, in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial \ninfarction (STEMI), the relationship between the HATCH score and NOAF remains \nunclear. This study aimed to assess the association between HATCH score and \nnew-onset AF (NOAF) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in STEMI \npatients.\nMETHODS: This single-center retrospective observation consecutively selected \npatients diagnosed with STEMI who underwent primary PCI. All patients received \ncontinuous electrocardiogram monitoring during hospitalization (\u2265\u200936\u00a0h). HATCH \nscore was calculated based on hypertension (1 point), age\u2009>\u200975 years (1 point), \nstroke or TIA (2 point), COPD (1 point), and HF (2 point).\nRESULTS: A total of 774 patients were included in this study, of whom 65.37% \nwere male, with a mean age of 63.53\u2009\u00b1\u200913.11 years, 73 patients (9.43%) developed \nNOAF. ROC curve demonstrated that the AUC of the HATCH score was 0.731, the cut \n- off value was 2.5. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that \nthe HATCH score (OR\u2009=\u20091.66, 95% CI: 1.41-1.95, P\u2009<\u20090.001) or HATCH score\u2009\u2265\u20093 \n(OR\u2009=\u20094.10, 95% CI: 2.39-7.02, P\u2009<\u20090.001) was an independent risk predictor for \nNOAF. The RCS analysis revealed a linear correlation between the HATCH score and \nNOAF (P for overall\u2009<\u20090.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Elevated HATCH score is an independent risk factor for the \ndevelopment of NOAF after PCI in STEMI patients. There was a linear \ndose-response relationship between HATCH score and NOAF.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Change in NT-proBNP level may provide additional \nactionable risk assessment information. This study aimed to determine the \nassociation of change in NT-proBNP level with adverse outcomes among elderly \nindividuals with type 2 myocardial infarction (MI).\nMETHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted among elderly individuals with \ntype 2 MI between December 2010 and December 2022. Change of NT-proBNP level was \ndetermined as the difference between the baseline and last measurement obtained \nduring the period of 30 days.\nRESULTS: A total of 3007 participants aged 80 years and older were included. The \npatients were divided in accordance with the change in NT-proBNP level into \nthose with NT-proBNP change\u2009\u2265\u200930% decrease, NT-proBNP change\u2009<\u200930% decrease and \n\u2264\u200910% increase, and NT-proBNP change\u2009>\u200910% increase. The patients with NT-proBNP \nchange\u2009>\u200910% increase were older, had higher systolic blood pressure, loop \ndiuretics use, and higher incidence of atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney \ndisease. The quartile of change in NT-proBNP\u2009>\u200910% increase was markedly \nassociated with increased risk of incident HF, as well as all-cause and \ncardiovascular mortality. The incidence rate of mortality increased in a graded \nfashion with change in NT-proBNP level. The Kaplan-Meier event-free curves \nshowed that patients with NT-proBNP change\u2009>\u200910% increase had the highest risk, \nfollowed by those with NT-proBNP change\u2009<\u200930% decrease and \u2264\u200910% increase, and \nNT-proBNP change\u2009\u2265\u200930% decrease.\nCONCLUSIONS: The change in NT-proBNP level can be used for identifying patients \nat a high risk of incident HF, as well as cardiovascular and all-cause mortality \nin elderly individuals with type 2 MI. It may be a promising biomarker to guide \npersonalized therapy optimization.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Various NHPRs were compared with FFR. The primary endpoint was \na composite of death (all-cause or cardiac) and myocardial \ninfarction/revascularization with several definitions. Secondary endpoint \nconsisted of death or myocardial infarction. The study is registered with \nPROSPERO (CRD42024628393).\nRESULTS: Six eligible trials with 9,854 intermediate lesions deferred for PCI \nwere considered in the analysis. Compared with concordant-negative physiology \n(FFR-/NHPRs-), deferral of PCI for discordant physiology was associated with an \nincrease in the primary endpoints (FFR-/NHPRs+: HR: 2.73 [1.95-3.80]; P < \n0.00001 and FFR+/NHPRs-: HR: 3.29[2.33-4.64]; P < 0.00001). Secondary \ndichotomous analysis showed that deferral of PCI in both discordant groups was \nassociated with an increase in the hard endpoints (death or myocardial \ninfarction) compared with concordant-negative physiology. Exploratory analysis \ncomparing revascularization vs deferral groups within discordant physiology \ndemonstrated reduction in the primary endpoint in the FFR+/NHPRs- group, but not \nin the FFR-/NHPRs+ group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Deferral of PCI in discordant-physiology was associated with worse \nlong-term outcomes compared with the concordant-negative physiology. There may \nbe a benefit of revascularization in FFR+/NHPRs- lesions, which requires further \ninvestigation.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

The most concerning of possible diagnoses is acute coronary \nsyndrome, yet it is not the only clinical entity that can cause ST-segment \nelevation. Herein, we present a case of a 62-year-old male current smoker with \npast medical history of uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia \npresenting with abdominal pain for 1\u2009week duration. His initial admission EKG \nillustrated ST-segment elevation; however, his clinical presentation, lack of \nanginal symptoms, normal bedside transthoracic echocardiogram, and normal range \ntroponin were not indicative of myocardial infarction. In fact, he was found to \nhave elevated lipase and CT findings consistent with acute pancreatitis. This \ncase highlights an uncommon presentation of pancreatitis and illustrates the \nimportance of obtaining a comprehensive clinical history when evaluating \npatients to ensure patient's receive efficient and appropriate care.\n\nDOI: 10.1177/23247096251352370\nPMCID: PMC12268134\nPMID: 40667677 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe \nauthor(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the \nresearch, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\n\n45.

Pannexin1 (PANX1) channels, which open during \napoptosis, facilitate the release of ATP from dying cells. However, the \nfunctional significance of PANX1 in mediating cardiomyocyte apoptosis and its \ncontribution to myocardial infarction progression remain to be fully elucidated. \nTo investigate the regulatory role of PANX1 in cardiomyocyte apoptosis following \nMI and elucidate its underlying molecular mechanisms. We conducted both in vivo \nand vitro studies. In vivo, we observed a significant elevation of PANX1 \nexpression levels in post-MI mice, which facilitated macrophage recruitment and \nsubsequently triggered upregulation of amphiregulin(AREG). In vitro, HL-1 cells \nexposure to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) induced apoptosis, accompanying with the \nupregulation of PANX1, enhanced extracellular ATP release. And these alterations \npromoted the recruitment of RAW264.7 cells, subsequently elevating AREG levels. \nThese effects were mitigated by the knockdown of PANX1. To confirm PANX1's role \nin MI hearts, AAV-9-PANX1-RNAi and negative control vectors were administered \ninto the hearts of mice. Over 28 days post-MI, PANX1 knockdown significantly \nenhanced cardiac function and attenuated myocardial fibrosis. Our findings \nreveal that PANX1 plays a crucial role in facilitating a link between apoptotic \ncardiomyocyte and macrophage, contributing to modulate myocardial fibrosis and \ncardiac dysfunctional recovery post-MI via the AREG. Furthermore, the \nPANX1/P2rx7/AREG pathway is essential for facilitating a link between apoptotic \ncardiomyocytes and macrophages in mice following MI.\n\n\u00a9 2025.
