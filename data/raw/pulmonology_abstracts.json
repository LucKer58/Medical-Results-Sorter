The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) technology \nhas established an intelligent framework for the entire bronchoscopic diagnostic \nprocess. Image recognition enables the precise localization of airway structures \nand lesions, while dynamic three-dimensional modeling refines navigation \npathways. Multi-dimensional imaging enhances diagnostic capabilities, and a \nhuman-machine interaction system improves operational accuracy. AI-assisted \ntraining and quality control systems have also been developed. This review \nexplores the applications and progress of AI in interventional pulmonology, \nemphasising its potential to advance the field towards precision and intelligent \nmedicine as AI algorithms continue to evolve and clinical research deepens.\n\nPublisher: \n\u4ecb\u5165\u547c\u5438\u75c5\u5b66\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u8fc5\u901f\uff0c\u652f\u6c14\u7ba1\u955c\u68c0\u67e5\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u547c\u5438\u7cfb\u7edf\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u7597\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u624b\u6bb5\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\u968f\u7740\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08AI\uff09\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u652f\u6c14\u7ba1\u955c\u8bca\u7597\u5168\u6d41\u7a0b\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff1a\u56fe\u50cf\u8bc6\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6c14\u9053\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u75c5\u7076\u7cbe\u51c6\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff1b\u4e09\u7ef4\u7b97\u6cd5\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u4f18\u5316\u5bfc\u822a\u8def\u5f84\uff1b\u8d4b\u80fd\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u62d3\u5c55\u8bca\u65ad\u8fb9\u754c\uff1b\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u5347\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u8f85\u52a9\u6559\u5b66\u4e0e\u8d28\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5bf9AI\u5728\u4ecb\u5165\u547c\u5438\u75c5\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e0e\u8fdb\u5c55\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u968f\u7740AI\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6df1\u5165\uff0c\u5c06\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a8\u52a8\u4ecb\u5165\u547c\u5438\u75c5\u5b66\u5411\u7cbe\u51c6\u533b\u7597\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u533b\u7597\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u3002.\n\nDOI: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112147-20250221-00100\nPMID: 40582978 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n2.

Methods: This was a cross-sectional survey. From January to March 2024, a \nquestionnaire survey was conducted using the stratified whole-cluster sampling \nmethod on 1 517 physicians in PCCM departments in 1 517 PCCM standardized \nconstruction units across 30 provinces in China. The 86-entry questionnaire \ncovered five modules, including subspecialty construction, diagnosis and \ntreatment implementation, and multidisciplinary collaboration. The data were \ncleaned and analysed using multiple response analysis and descriptive statistics \nin Excel 2021 and SPSS 26.0. Results: A total of 1 516 physicians were included \n(75% from tertiary hospitals; 50.52% holding master's degrees or higher). Among \nthem, 91.95% (1 394/1 516) expressed the willingness to manage lung cancer \npatients. Key findings included: 41.75% (633/1 516) of institutions had \nestablished dedicated lung cancer outpatient clinics; 50.79% (770/1 516) had \nspecialized wards; 64% (965/1 516) operated multidisciplinary team (MDT) \nplatforms. Tertiary hospitals retained significantly higher proportions of lung \ncancer inpatients than secondary hospitals (16.47% vs. 8.89%). Regional \ndisparities were evident, with non-tertiary hospitals and institutions in \ncentral and western China showing eleficiencies in subspecialty staffing (mean: \n2.84 physicians/hospital), advanced endoscopic techniques (e.g. navigational \nbronchoscopy coverage<30%), and targeted therapy implementation (86.28%). \nPrimary reasons for refusal to treat were a lack of subspecialty-trained \nphysicians (73.80%), insufficient pathological support (41.00%), and inadequate \nfinancial incentives at primary care levels (23.00%). Conclusions: The PCCM \ndepartment demonstrates high specialized in lung cancer diagnosis and treatment, \nand the vast majority of doctors have the ability to manage lung cancer \npatients. It has emerged as the primary department for initial lung cancer \ndiagnosis, reflecting its central role in diagnosis and treatment. Although \nsubspecialty development has enhanced diagnostic-therapeutic quality, regional \nresource disparities persist. Strategies such as implementing subspecialty \ncertification programs, establishing regional pathological diagnosis centers, \nand improving technical support mechanisms for primary care are recommended to \nachieve homogeneous lung cancer care nationwide.\n\nPublisher: \u76ee\u7684\uff1a \u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6211\u56fd\u547c\u5438\u4e0e\u5371\u91cd\u75c7\u533b\u5b66\u79d1\uff08PCCM\u79d1\uff09\u80ba\u764c\u4e9a\u4e13\u4e1a\u4e34\u5e8a\u8d44\u6e90\u914d\u7f6e\u73b0\u72b6\u4e0e\u8bca\u7597\u80fd\u529b\u6c34\u5e73\u3002 \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a \n\u91c7\u7528\u6a2a\u65ad\u9762\u8c03\u67e5\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e8e2024\u5e741\u20143\u6708\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u6574\u7fa4\u62bd\u6837\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u5168\u56fd30\u4e2a\u7701\u4efd1 517\u5bb6PCCM\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u5efa\u8bbe\u5355\u4f4d\u4e2d\u76841 \n517\u540dPCCM\u79d1\u533b\u5e08\u8fdb\u884c\u95ee\u5377\u8c03\u67e5\u3002\u95ee\u5377\u6db5\u76d6\u4e9a\u4e13\u79d1\u5efa\u8bbe\u3001\u8bca\u7597\u5b9e\u65bd\u3001\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u534f\u4f5c\u7b495\u5927\u6a21\u575786\u4e2a\u6761\u76ee\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u91cd\u54cd\u5e94\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e94\u7528Excel \n2021\u4e0eSPSS 26.0\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u6e05\u6d17\u53ca\u5206\u6790\u3002 \u7ed3\u679c\uff1a \u6700\u7ec8\u5171\u7eb3\u51651 516\u540d\u533b\u751f\uff08\u4e09\u7ea7\u533b\u966275%\uff0c\u7855\u58eb\u4ee5\u4e0a\u5b66\u538650.52%\uff09\uff0c91.95%\uff081 394/1 \n516\uff09\u5177\u5907\u63a5\u8bca\u610f\u613f\u300241.75%\uff08633/1 516\uff09\u7684\u673a\u6784\u8bbe\u7acb\u80ba\u764c\u95e8\u8bca\uff0c50.79%\uff08770/1 516\uff09\u8bbe\u6709\u4e13\u79d1\u75c5\u623f\uff0c64%\uff08965/1 \n516\uff09\u5177\u5907\u80ba\u764c\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u534f\u4f5c\uff08MDT\uff09\u5e73\u53f0\u3002\u4e09\u7532\u533b\u9662\u80ba\u764c\u4f4f\u9662\u60a3\u8005\u5360\u6bd4\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4e8c\u7ea7\u533b\u9662\uff0816.47%\u6bd48.89%\uff09\u3002\u533a\u57df\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u975e\u4e09\u7532\u533b\u9662\u53ca\u4e2d\u897f\u90e8\u5730\u533a\u5728\u4e9a\u4e13\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u914d\u7f6e\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u6bcf\u5bb6\u533b\u96622.84\u540d\u3001\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5185\u955c\u6280\u672f\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982\u5bfc\u822a\u652f\u6c14\u7ba1\u955c\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u7387<30%\uff09\u53ca\u9776\u5411\u6cbb\u7597\u5f00\u5c55\uff0886.28%\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u62d2\u7edd\u63a5\u8bca\u4e3b\u56e0\u5305\u62ec\u4e9a\u4e13\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u7f3a\u4e4f\uff0873.80%\uff09\u3001\u75c5\u7406\u914d\u5957\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0841.00%\uff09\u53ca\u57fa\u5c42\u6536\u76ca\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0823.00%\uff09\u3002 \n\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a \nPCCM\u5b66\u79d1\u5728\u80ba\u764c\u8bca\u7597\u9886\u57df\u5df2\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e13\u4e1a\u6027\uff0c\u7edd\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u533b\u751f\u5177\u5907\u63a5\u8bca\u80ba\u764c\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u80ba\u764c\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u9996\u8bca\u79d1\u5ba4\u5728\u80ba\u764c\u8bca\u7597\u4e2d\u5904\u4e8e\u6838\u5fc3\u5730\u4f4d\u3002\u80ba\u764c\u4e9a\u4e13\u79d1\u7684\u5efa\u8bbe\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u80ba\u764c\u8bca\u7597\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u533a\u57df\u8d44\u6e90\u914d\u7f6e\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u884c\u4e9a\u4e13\u79d1\u8ba4\u8bc1\u5236\u5ea6\u3001\u5efa\u8bbe\u533a\u57df\u6027\u75c5\u7406\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3001\u5b8c\u5584\u57fa\u5c42\u6280\u672f\u4e0b\u6c89\u673a\u5236\u7b49\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u80ba\u764c\u8bca\u7597\u540c\u8d28\u5316\u53d1\u5c55\u3002.\n\nDOI: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112147-20250224-00106\nPMID: 40582974 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n3.

Given the complexity of both procedures and patients, \nanesthesiologists are an integral part of the team, and familiarity with \nprocedure steps, risks and complications is very important, as it is close \ncollaboration with the proceduralists.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Due to the complexity of procedures, such as robotic \nbronchoscopy, lung ablations, and patients, specific ventilatory strategies need \nto be employed. Recent advancements in robotic bronchoscopy and intraoperative \n3D imaging allow the precise localization of lung nodules. Another major \nadvancement is the pulsed electrical energy ablation into the nodule, inducing \ncell death. Our anesthetic approach must be tailored to these techniques to \nminimize atelectasis and risk of fire.\nSUMMARY: Due to the complexity of new procedures, interventional pulmonology \nnecessitates a careful, patient-tailored, anesthetic approach. The recent \nadvancements in robotic bronchoscopy, lung markings and pulse electrical \nablations require specific anesthetic techniques, and knowledge of the procedure \nsteps, risks is crucial. Departments might create interventional pulmonology, \nbronchoscopy anesthesia teams to improve patient safety and team satisfaction.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

It is a high-risk department for MDRPI. Once \nMDRPI occurs, it is not easy to heal and may lead to various complications and \naffect the disease prognosis. At present, there is no specialised assessment \ntool for PCCM patients. A multi-centre prospective study. We collected data from \n932 PCCM patients who used medical devices in three Grade III Class A \nComprehensive Hospitals from November 2022 to October 2023. Of those, 652 cases \nwere assigned to the modelling and 280 to the verification groups. Logistic \nregression was used to construct the model. The AUC was used to test the \npredictive effect of the model. The risk assessment tool was constructed with \nthe OR (odds ratio) value obtained by binary Logistic multi-variate regression \nanalysis. Verification groups were used for validated the risk assessment tool. \nThe factors entered into the prediction model were use of nasal catheter, high \nflow oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation, invasive ventilation, having \nchronic respiratory disease, using hormonal drugs, sedative drugs and abnormal \nskin condition. The prediction model was transformed into a risk assessment \ntool, and the OR values were rounded to form the MDRPI risk assessment tool with \nthe values ranging from 0 to 66 points. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is \n0.861, and the maximum value of Youden index (YI) is 0.606, corresponding to a \nsensitivity of 80.6%, specificity of 80.0% and a cut-off value of 17, divided \npatients into low risk\u2009\u2264\u200917 and high risk\u2009>\u200917. The risk assessment tool applied \nto the clinic, and the accuracy was 92.75%. The risk assessment tool can provide \nclinical guidance and predict the risk of MDRPI for PCCM patients. Clinical \nnurses in PCCM can use the risk assessment tool to assess the risk of MDRPI \noccurrence and provide a reference for preventive measures.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

Prior to the study, \nflow/thermography tests were conducted to assess the efficacy of the silicone \ncatheter. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis before, during, and after anesthesia \nas well as patient hemodynamic and oxygen saturation (SpO2) data recorded during \nthe procedure were evaluated. Patients were observed for up to 24\u00a0h following \nthe procedure. The procedure included the following steps: (1) HFJV application \nwith Evone\u00ae (Ventinova, Eindhoven, Netherlands) ventilator after intubation with \nan orotracheal silicone catheter; (2) HFJV termination and manual ventilation \n(MV) application in cases of hypoxia, hypercapnia, and hemodynamic instability; \n(3) flow-controlled ventilation (FCV) with a laryngeal mask or tracheal \nintubation in patients who cannot be managed with MV; and (4) close hemodynamic \nmonitoring as well as ABG analysis during the procedure.\nRESULT: A total of 25 patients were included in the study. The median duration \nof the procedure was 35\u00a0min. In 21 (84%) patients, the procedure was \nsuccessfully performed with HFJV using a silicone ventilation catheter. In these \nsuccessful cases, the hemodynamic parameters and ABG values remained within \nnormal limits throughout the procedure. The median values of arterial oxygen \npartial pressure (PaO2), arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure (PaCO2), SpO2, \nand pH were 210 mmHg, 41.6 mmHg, 99.4%, and 7.37, respectively, when considering \nthe worst ABG values during the procedure. Hypoxia (SpO2\u2009<\u200990%) was detected in \n4% (n\u2009=\u20091) of patients, while hypercarbia (PaCO2\u2009\u2265\u200950 mmHg) was observed in 16% \n(n\u2009=\u20094). The utilization of a Y-stent was necessary in one patient (4%). One \npatient (4%) experienced severe bleeding during the resection process, and one \n(4%) patient underwent orotracheal intubation. Postoperative pulmonary \ncomplications or adverse events were not observed in any patient.\nCONCLUSION: The findings of the present study demonstrated that the utilization \nof silicone catheters in conjunction with HFJV is both safe and efficacious for \nIP and RB procedures. These results suggest that HFJV with a silicone catheter \nmay be a viable option in RB procedures.\nCLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: It cannot be applicable because it is a retrospective \nstudy.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Studies were chosen for their relevance to \nprediction models, AI-driven diagnostics, and personalized treatments. This \nnarrative review highlights technological advancements, clinical applications, \nand challenges in integrating AI into standard practice, with emphasis on \npredictive tools, deep learning for imaging, and patient outcomes.\nEXPERT OPINION: Despite these advancements, significant challenges remain in \nfully integrating AI into pulmonary health care. The need for large, diverse \ndatasets to train AI models is critical, and concerns around data privacy, \nalgorithmic transparency, and potential biases must be carefully managed. \nRegulatory frameworks also need to evolve to address the unique challenges posed \nby AI in health care. However, with continued research and collaboration between \ntechnology developers, clinicians, and policymakers, AI has the potential to \nrevolutionize pulmonary health care, ultimately leading to more effective, \nefficient, and personalized care for patients.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/17476348.2025.2491723\nPMID: 40210489 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n13.

However, the \npatterns of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) spread over time and space in \nShijiazhuang remain poorly understood. This study aims to clarify the \nspatio-temporal dynamics of PTB transmission in this region.\nMETHODS: We conducted a retrospective study using PTB surveillance data from \n2010 to 2023, extracted from the national Tuberculosis Information Management \nSystem. Descriptive epidemiological analysis was conducted to assess the \nseverity and distribution characteristics of PTB in Shijiazhuang. The Joinpoint \nregression model was employed to analyze the annual temporal trends. Spatial \nautocorrelation analysis and Space-time scan analysis were utilized to explore \nthe spatio-temporal clustering characteristics.\nRESULTS: From 2010 to 2023, a total of 54,855 PTB cases were reported, with an \naverage annual incidence of 38.97 per 100,000 population. Males, older adults, \nand farmers were disproportionately affected. The overall incidence declined \nsignificantly (AAPC\u202f=\u202f-7.65%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05), with a steeper drop between 2010 to \n2013 and a more gradual decline thereafter. Spatial analysis revealed persistent \nhigh-high clusters in rural counties such as Lingshou county and Pingshan \ncounty, and low-low clusters in central urban districts. The phased space-time \nscan analysis results identified 19 clusters.\nCONCLUSION: This study reveals a declining PTB incidence in Shijiazhuang, with a \nhigher burden among males, older adults, and farmers, alongside persistent \nspatial clusters in rural areas, particularly in the north. These findings \nemphasize the need for targeted interventions and strengthened rural \nsurveillance to achieve tuberculosis elimination goals.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Wang, Guo, Shi and Cui.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fpubh.2025.1621695\nPMCID: PMC12267174\nPMID: 40678650 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n14.

The COVID-19 pandemic has \naccelerated the transformation of healthcare services, emphasizing the use of \ndigital resources. Given the rapid brain development in infants in the first \n1,000\u202fdays of life and the demonstrated impact of adaptive neuroplasticity, the \nimplementation of early and ecological interventions are essential for \nsupporting optimal neurodevelopment in this vulnerable population. Aim of this \nproject is to develop a digital tool for parent-led parent-based intervention \nand assess its feasibility and accessibility.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected evidence on early intervention strategies \nfor preterm infants through a non-systematic review of current literature to \ndevelop the platform and created an ad-hoc questionnaire to evaluate the tool's \nfeasibility and acceptability in our neurological follow-up.\nRESULTS: \"NE@R\" is a digital platform designed to support neurodevelopment \nthrough parents-delivered play. The platform offers evidence-based information, \nvideos, and practical activities to enhance motor, cognitive, social, and \nlanguage development at each developmental phase. We introduce the resource in \nour clinical setting and collect 100 preterm infants' families feedback. The \nmajority of parents reported finding the resource beneficial, with many \nexpressing increased confidence in supporting their child's development.\nDISCUSSION: Preterm babies families' support represents a precious field of \nintervention both for parents and infants at risk. \"NE@R\" has proven to be an \neffective, low-cost tool within our follow-up program, aligning with the \nprinciples of family-centered care.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Trussardi, Naboni, Caporali, Pisoni, Ghirardello and Orcesi.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fpubh.2025.1597244\nPMCID: PMC12267281\nPMID: 40678635 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n17.

It is \nassociated with increased morbidity, prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay, \nand healthcare burden.\nMETHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis according to PRISMA \n2020 guidelines. Studies published between January 2021 and December 2023 were \nidentified from PubMed, Embase, and Scopus. Eligible studies reported the \nincidence and/or perioperative risk factors for PIP with odds ratios (ORs) and \n95% confidence intervals (CIs). A random-effects model was used for pooled \nestimates. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The \nreview was prospectively registered in PROSPERO 2025 CRD 420251057914. Available \nfrom https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD420251057914.\nRESULTS: Six high-quality cohort studies involving 4,392 patients were included. \nThe pooled incidence of PIP was 14.8% (95% CI, 10.6%-19.2%). Incidence was \nhighest after thoracic oncologic surgery (17.2%), followed by valve surgery \n(15.8%) and CABG (13.5%). Significant risk factors included prolonged mechanical \nventilation >48 hours (OR: 3.46), age >70 years (OR: 2.71), chronic obstructive \npulmonary disease (OR: 2.95), cardiopulmonary bypass time >120 minutes (OR: \n2.63), and left ventricular ejection fraction <40% (OR: 2.38). Heterogeneity was \nmoderate (I 2 = 46%) with no publication bias.\nCONCLUSIONS: PIP remains a major postoperative concern. Identification of key \nrisk factors enables targeted preventive strategies-early extubation, pulmonary \noptimization, and standardized care pathways-to reduce PIP incidence and improve \noutcomes.\n\nCopyright: \u00a9 2025 Khallikane S et al.\n\nDOI: 10.12688/f1000research.165457.1\nPMCID: PMC12268255\nPMID: 40678345 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: No competing interests were disclosed.\n\n\n18.

However, prior research has overlooked \nthe connection between intergenerational solidarity-social cohesion between \ngenerations-and self-esteem across Western and Asian families during the \npandemic. We aimed to discover common unobserved latent classes of \nintergenerational solidarity with older parents among middle-aged adults during \nthe pandemic in the United States and South Korea. In addition, we sought to \ndetermine if the identified solidarity latent classes were linked to the \nself-esteem of middle-aged adults, and whether the above association varies \naccording to parents' gender or cultural contexts. We used data from the 2022 \nsurveys of the Longitudinal Study of Generations and Korean Generation Study, \nand conducted multigroup latent class analysis for 247 child-mother and 205 \nchild-father groups in the United States and 229 child-mother and 155 \nchild-father groups in South Korea. In addition, multivariate regression \nanalysis based on the three-step approach was conducted. We identified the same \nthree intergenerational solidarity latent classes in the four groups: \ntight-knit, intimate-but-distant, and detached. Furthermore, we found that \nmiddle-aged adults with a tight-knit relationship with older parents reported \nhigher self-esteem than those who had intimate-but-distant and detached types of \nrelationships with older parents, irrespective of parents' gender and national \ncontext. Our results suggest that fostering stronger intergenerational \nrelationships would be beneficial for middle-aged adults in both cultures, \nregardless of the gender of their parents. We provide insight to clarify the \nunderstanding of the role of intergenerational solidarity in midlife in American \nand Korean cultural contexts.\n\n\u00a9 2025 Family Process Institute.\n\nDOI: 10.1111/famp.70056\nPMID: 40677212 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n19.

Methods: A \nliterature retrival of research papers in this field published as of November \n30, 2024 was conducted based on three databases (i.e. PubMed, Web of Science, \nand Scopus). The papers which were highly cited were analyzed by Bibliometrix \npackage in R 4.3.2. The co-occurrence network of keywords were analyzed by using \nsoftware VOSviewer. The keyword burst test was carried out with software \nCiteSpace. Results: A total of 685 papers from 314 journals were included. The \nannual number of the papers published showed a significant growth in recent \nthree years. JAMA Network Open had the highest publication mumber related to TTE \n(34 papers), Annals of Internal Medicine had the highest H-index and American \nJournal of Epidemiology had the highest total citations. In the 2 997 authors, \nHern\u00e1n MA made a greatest contribution. In the 2 046 institutions, Harvard \nMedical School was at leading position. The analysis on highly cited papers and \nkeyword co-occurrence showed that TTE was mainly used in the studies of COVID-19 \nvaccine, cancer and the treatment efficacy and safety of chronic diseases. The \nanalysis on the co-occurence of keyword burst test showed that keywords \nfrequently used until 2024 were COVID-19 vaccine, cardiovascular disease and \nbreast cancer. Conclusions: TTE is mainly used in the studies of public health \nemergency (such as COVID-19), patients with cancer and chronic diseases.

Methods: The \nregistration data of etiologically positive pulmonary TB cases in Shaanxi from \n2015 to 2023 were collected from the tuberculosis subsystem of Chinese Disease \nControl and Prevention Information System. Descriptive method was used to \nanalyze the basic characteristics of the etiologically positive pulmonary TB \ncases. Linear trend \u03c72 test was used to analyze trends in registration rate and \npathogen positive rate. Software SPSS 25.0 was used for statistical analysis. \nSoftware ArcGIS 10.8 was used for global spatial autocorrelation and hotspot \nanalysis to explore spatial clustering of the etiologically positive pulmonary \nTB cases. Software SaTScan 10.0 was used for spatiotemporal scan statistics, and \nsoftware ArcGIS 10.8 was used to visualize the spatiotemporal clustering. \nResults: A total of 64 148 cases of etiologically positive pulmonary TB were \nregistered in Shaanxi from 2015 to 2023, with an average annual registration \nrate of 18.33/100 000. The registration rate and pathgen positive rate all \nshowed upward trends from 2015 to 2023, and the differences were significant \n(the trend \u03c72=4 555.18 and 19 330.43, both P<0.001). Global spatial \nautocorrelation and hotspot analysis showed that the registration rate of \netiologically positive pulmonary TB in Shaanxi from 2017 to 2023 showed a \nspatial clustering. The hotspots were mainly in Zhenba and Xixiang counties of \nHanzhong, six counties (districts) of Ankang, and Yanchuan and Yanchang counties \nof Yan'an. The coldspots were mainly in parts of the Guanzhong area, including \nBaoji, Xi'an, and Xianyang. A total of 4 spatiotemporal clustering areas were \nexplored by spatiotemporal scanning analysis (all P<0.001), in which the \nfirst-level clustering areas covered 17 counties (districts), mainly Zhenping, \nZiyang, Zhenba, in southern Shaanxi from 2019 to 2022, the second-level \nclustering areas covered 6 counties (districts), mainly Yanchuan, Yanchang, \nQingjian, in northern Shaanxi from 2018 to 2021, the third-level clustering \nareas covered 14 counties (districts), mainly Yanta, Chang'an, Jingyang, in \nGuanzhong area from 2018 to 2019, and the fourth-level clustering areas covered \n10 counties (districts) from 2019 to 2021. Conclusions: The registration rate of \nlabortory confirmed pulmonary TB cases in Shaanxi showed an upward trend, with \nobvious differences in spatiotemporal clustering distribution.

The model considers the population density of susceptible, \ninfected, and recovered individuals. The models are based on a system of partial \ndifferential equations. The first model considers a space-invariant transmission \nrate, and the second modeling approach is based on different space-variant \ntransmission rates. The third modeling approach, which is more complex, uses a \ntransmission rate that varies with space and time. One main aim of this study is \nto present the advantages and drawbacks of the mathematical approaches proposed \nto describe the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile. We show that the calibration of the \nmodels is challenging. The results of the model's calibration suggest that the \nspread of SARS-CoV-2 in the regions of Chile was different. Moreover, this study \nprovides additional insight since few studies have explored similar mathematical \nmodeling approaches with real-world data.\n\nDOI: 10.3934/mbe.2025062\nPMID: 40676990 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n22.

The metastatic process is \ndriven by complex biological mechanisms, including tumor cell-specific \nadaptations of growth pathways, immune modulation within the tumor \nmicroenvironment, and reactivation of metastatic cells from dormancy. This \nscoping review captures overlooked and under researched pathways, supporting \nmainstream therapeutic targets while shedding light on novel ones, reinforcing \nand revising conclusions drawn in previous literature, and guiding future \nresearch. MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched with a publication \ndate limit from 2019 onwards using relevant MeSH terms combined with Boolean \noperators, truncations, and keyword searches. The search culminated in 43 \nreports, including 30 in vivo, 8 in vitro, and 5 observational studies. This \nstudy conforms to the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Tumor cell adaptations, including \nepithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhanced migratory and proliferative \nsignaling via JAK/STAT and TGF-\u03b2 pathways, are critical drivers of OS lung \nmetastasis. Manipulated upstream ligand-driven signaling promotes \ntranscriptional changes that increase cell cycle proteins and mesenchymal \nmarkers, conferring chemoresistance and advancing OS cells toward a metastatic \nstate. The tumor microenvironment also plays a key role; interactions between OS \ncell-derived cytokines and tumor-infiltrating immune cells lead to tumor \nassociated macrophages and neutrophils (TAMs/TANs), which help establish a \npre-metastatic niche and provoke immune remodeling. However, the impact of TAMs \non OS survival remains ambiguous due to their dual pro- and anti-tumor roles. \nLung-induced dormancy links tumor intrinsic and immune-driven mechanisms, \nallowing tumor cells to evade immunity or pause progression. Inflammatory \npathways and immune activation can reverse dormancy, promoting further OS \ndissemination. The reviewed evidence supports targeting intracellular signaling \nand immune pathways to mitigate OS metastasis. The paucity of longitudinal data \non lung dormancy warrants caution, emphasizing integrated approaches and better \ncontrolled studies with focus on combinatorial therapies for more conclusive \noutcomes.\n\nDOI: 10.1177/15330338251359716\nPMID: 40676851 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe authors \ndeclared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, \nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\n\n23.

While COPD is known to increase lung cancer risk, the \nexact underlying mechanism remains unclear. We aim to explore the potential \nrelationship between lung adenocarcinoma (LA) and COPD by application of \nMendelian randomization analysis and single-cell RNA sequencing.\nMETHODS: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from the peripheral blood \nof patients with COPD and LA were collected to analyze the changes in the \nproportion of cell subpopulations under the two pathological conditions and \nscreen out CD4\u00a0+\u00a0T cell subpopulations as the focus of research. The causal \nrelationship between the expression of key marker genes in COPD and LA was \nexplored using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, combined with expression \nquantitative trait loci (eQTL) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) data.\nRESULTS: Of the 38 genes screened by differential expression analysis in CD4\u00a0+\u00a0T \ncell scRNA-seq data, CXCR4 showed a protective effect against LA in MR analysis \n(OR\u00a0=\u00a00.6806; 95% CI: 0.4653-0.9957). CXCR4\u00a0+\u00a0CD4\u00a0+\u00a0T cells showed significant \ninteractions with endothelial cells and immune cells such as macrophages, \nsuggesting its crucial role in the immune response.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study analyzed the role of CD4\u00a0+\u00a0T cells in COPD and lung \nadenocarcinoma and found that the CXCR4 gene may affect lung adenocarcinoma \ndevelopment, providing new insights into the link between COPD and lung \nadenocarcinoma.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

It focuses on assessing postoperative functional recovery, \nincluding swallowing, airway patency, phonation, and speech, while also \nconsidering the associated morbidities and immunosuppressive strategies.\nMETHODS: A systematic review was conducted for functional outcomes of total \nlaryngeal transplantation through PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Web of \nScience databases according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews \nand Meta-Analyses guidelines. Case reports, case series, letters to the editor, \nreviews, and preclinical studies related to laryngeal transplantation were \neligible for inclusion. Methodological quality and risk of bias were assessed \nvia the CAMARADES checklist for preclinical studies and the JBI checklists for \nclinical studies.\nRESULTS: Out of n=188 identified studies, n=16 (8.5%) met the inclusion \ncriteria. There were n=13 (81%) clinical and n=3 (19%) preclinical studies. In \npreclinical models, canine and minipig studies showed partial recovery: \nelectrical stimulation restored vocal fold mobility in n=8 (40%) of canine \nallografts; some minipigs recovered swallowing, vocalization, and short-term \nsurvival post-transplant without immunosuppression, though all canines remained \ntracheostomy-dependent. Among n=18 (100%) human recipients, speech or phonation \nwas restored fully or partially in n=12 (67%), as well as full or partial oral \nintake. Here, n=3 patients (17%) died within two years post-VCA, while n=4 (36%) \nresumed full oral intake. Voice quality was considered as satisfactory or better \nthan pre-VCA in n=6 (55%) patients, whereas airway patency was deemed good or \nexcellent. Nonetheless, no patient regained full vocal fold mobility. However, \nn=1 (5.6%) patient was able to breathe without a tracheostomy, and n=1 (5.6%) \ncould intermittently cap their tracheostomy tube. Immunosuppressive regimens \nincluded tacrolimus (n=18, 100%), mycophenolate mofetil (n=15, 83%), \ncorticosteroids (n=15, 83%), and anti-thymocyte globulin (n=6, 33%), with \nadjunctive use of leflunomide and stem cells in select cases.\nCONCLUSION: Laryngeal transplantation shows promising results in restoring \nswallowing and phonation, but challenges remain for breathing without \ntracheostomy. The procedure remains an experimental surgery, still associated \nwith significant morbidity and mortality, and requires lifelong \nimmunosuppression. Future research, including long-term follow-up, larger-scale \ntrials and interdisciplinary collaboration, is essential to further refine this \nprocedure and evaluate its outcomes comprehensively.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Henderson, Knoedler, Niederegger, Fenske, Mathieu, Hundeshagen, \nHeiland, Cetrulo, Farwell, Lechien and Lellouch.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1631525\nPMCID: PMC12267005\nPMID: 40677707 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.

To interrogate how \nmechanical stiffness of the ECM affects microvascular remodeling, we developed a \nbioactive poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogel model with tunable \nstiffness that permits microvascular sprouting.\nMETHODS: Lung explants harvested from healthy and fibrotic mice were cultured \nex\u00a0vivo on PEGDA hydrogels for 7\u2009days. Capillary sprouting from lung segments \nwas evaluated via imaging and secreted angiogenic markers.\nRESULTS: Healthy lung explants had decreased sprout formation and length on \nstiffer hydrogels. The sprouts from fibrotic lung explants, however, were not \nimpacted by hydrogel stiffness. This difference was associated with higher \nexpression of angiogenic markers and matrix remodeling enzymes in the fibrotic \nlung explants.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a compensation in vasculature derived from \nfibrotic tissue to matrix mechanics in promoting angiogenic sprouting.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

This topic remains challenging because \nof the low image quality of soft tissue CT. Additionally, soft tissue samples \nusually deform during the histology slide preparation, making it difficult to \ncorrelate the structures between the histology slide and \u00b5CT. In this work, we \npropose a novel 2D-3D multi-modal deformable image registration method. The \nmethod utilizes an initial global 2D-3D registration using an ML-based \ndifferentiable similarity measure. The registration is then finalized by an \nanalytical out-of-plane deformation refinement. The method is evaluated on \ndatasets acquired from tonsil and tumor tissues. \u00b5CTs of both phase-contrast and \nconventional absorption modalities are investigated. The registration results \nfrom the proposed method are compared with those from intensity- and \nkeypoint-based methods.

Thrombospondin-2 (THBS2), an ECM glycoprotein encoding gene, has been \nextensively studied in liver and heart fibrosis. However, its role in idiopathic \npulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in humans remains incompletely understood. Lung \nfibroblasts were obtained from normal individuals and IPF patients, and THBS2 \nexpression was detected. Then, THBS2 overexpression and knockdown cell models as \nwell as exogenous human THBS2 active protein administration cell models were \nestablished to explore the role of THBS2 in cell aggressive phenotype, collagen \nsynthesis and proinflammatory mediator secretion. Furthermore, TGF-\u03b21 inhibitor \nwas used to investigate the underlying mechanism of THBS2 affecting collagen \nsynthesis. Finally, in the bleomycin (BLM) -induced pulmonary fibrosis model, \nthe severity of pulmonary fibrosis in mice was evaluated by administering \nexogenous mouse THBS2 active protein. THBS2 expression was significantly \nup-regulated in lung tissues of IPF patients and in IPF lung fibroblasts. THBS2 \nOverexpression and exogenous human THBS2 active protein markedly enhanced the \nproliferation and migration of fibroblasts and increased the levels of COL1A1, \nCOL1A2, COL3A1, LOX and LOXL2. These effects were attenuated after knockdown of \nTHBS2 in IPF fibroblasts. Animal models also confirmed that exogenous mouse \nTHBS2 protein could aggravate bleomycin-induced pathological changes and \ncollagen deposition in lung tissues of mice. Using TGF-\u03b21 inhibitor SB525334 \nreduced the protein expression of downstream molecules (TGFBR1, TGFBR2, \nP-Smad2/3) and collagen synthesis but did not inhibit the upregulation of \npost-translational modification enzymes LOX and LOXL2 involved in collagen \nsynthesis. Meanwhile, we observed that THBS2 overexpression significantly \npromoted inflammatory secretome (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-8). THBS2 is overexpressed \nin IPF. Functionally, THBS2 promotes the invasive phenotype (proliferation and \nmigration), collagen synthesis and inflammation secretome in fibroblasts. \nMechanistically, THBS2 promotes collagen synthesis through the TGF-\u03b21/Smad2/3 \nsignaling pathway.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Mucosal swelling \nfrom a cold or allergic rhinitis (AR) can obstruct pressure equalization, \nleading to mucosal tears, cranial pain, and nasal bleeding. Despite its \nsignificance in aerospace medicine, high-quality imaging, nasal endoscopy, \nlong-term outcomes, and the impact of AR management on sinus barotrauma remain \ninadequately documented in the literature.\nCASE REPORT: A 29-yr-old healthy male healthcare provider experienced severe \nfrontal sinus barotrauma during aircraft descent, presenting with intense \nfrontal headache, ocular pain, and left epistaxis, with head computed tomography \nrevealing a fully opacified left frontal sinus. Despite experiencing persistent \nsevere AR symptoms daily, he had never been diagnosed or treated for AR, and his \nsymptoms worsened during the flight. The clinical presentations and image \nfindings suggested a diagnosis of frontal sinus barotrauma. His initial \ntreatment included oral decongestants, antihistamines, and acetaminophen. \nRemarkably, follow-up computed tomography/magnetic resonance images over 2 wk, 1 \nmo, and 1 yr demonstrated the spontaneous resorption of the submucosal \nhemorrhage in the frontal sinus. Furthermore, though concurrently diagnosed with \nperennial AR due to house dust mite and cat fur sensitization, the patient's \neffective pharmacological management of AR symptoms led to an uneventful flight \n1 yr later.\nDISCUSSION: This case demonstrates that submucosal hemorrhages in the affected \nsinus generally resolve spontaneously within a year. Also, it highlights the \ncritical need for diagnosing and managing sinonasal disorders in symptomatic \nindividuals before flights to prevent sinus barotrauma. Park MJ, Kang SJ, Kim \nGT, Kim S.

Although COVID-19 was reported in some dogs, \ntheir roles in transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to other species remain unclear.

These nodules are incidentally discovered \non imaging and bronchoscopy performed for unrelated respiratory symptoms. The \nexact etiopathogenesis is unclear, with various hypotheses proposed. The most \nwidely accepted one is that chronic inflammation leads to cartilaginous and \nosseous metaplasia of the tracheobronchial submucosa. TPO is rare, with the \nprevalence further underestimated due to the incidental nature of the diagnosis. \nClinically, patients may be asymptomatic or can have nonspecific symptoms such \nas chronic cough, dyspnea, and recurrent respiratory infections. Suspicion of \nthe diagnosis arises upon incidental identification of nodules in the \ntracheobronchial lumen. Diagnosis is established through bronchoscopic \nvisualization of characteristic nodular lesions sparing the posterior wall and \ncan be confirmed by histopathologic examination showing submucosal cartilage \nformation and ossification. Management is generally conservative, focusing on \nsymptomatic relief and treatment of infections. Severe cases with significant \nairway obstruction may warrant advanced bronchoscopic procedures or surgical \ninterventions. Despite its benign nature, TPO can mimic other serious tracheal \ndiseases. Awareness of this condition is essential for accurate diagnosis and \nappropriate management. We present a case of a 65-year-old asymptomatic chronic \nsmoker who was found to have tracheal nodules on thoracic imaging. Bronchoscopic \nevaluation was consistent with TPO, with histopathology reaffirming the \ndiagnosis.\n\nDOI: 10.1177/23247096251357757\nPMID: 40673551 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe \nauthor(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the \nresearch, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\n\n32.

Dental materials account for approximately 15-20% of \nforeign body aspirations in adults, with symptoms that can include dyspnea, \nlocalized wheezing, and, in some cases, cyanosis and pneumonia. We report the \ncase of a 60-year-old man who aspirated a dental crown, resulting in shortness \nof breath. A computed tomography scan revealed the crown lodged in the left main \nbronchus. The patient underwent successful bronchoscopy for foreign body removal \nand experienced a full recovery without complications. Neurological conditions, \nsuch as epilepsy or Parkinson's disease, increase the risk of aspiration, \nparticularly in elderly patients, in which symptoms may be misdiagnosed due to \ntheir nonspecific presentation. While the right bronchus is more commonly \naffected due to anatomical structure, foreign body aspiration in the left \nbronchus also warrants attention. This case underscores the importance of rapid \nimaging and bronchoscopy to reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality from \naspiration events. Increased awareness and timely intervention are essential for \nimproving patient outcomes in cases of dental and other foreign body aspirations \nin older populations.\n\nDOI: 10.14712/23362936.2025.13\nPMID: 40673325 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n33.

The expression levels of TLR4/NF\u2011\u03baB \npathway-associated mRNAs and proteins were determined by qRT-PCR and Western \nblotting.\nRESULTS: CSE exposure significantly increased secretions of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and \nTNF-\u03b1, mRNA and protein expressions of MUC5AC and MUC5B, and early and total \napoptosis rates in BEAS-2B cells, where the presence of apoptotic bodies was \ndetected. CSE also significantly enhanced the mRNA and protein expressions of \nTLR4, I-\u03baB, and NF-\u03baB and reduced mRNA and protein expressions of AQP5. \nTreatments of the CSE-exposed cells with BYF-medicated serum, PDTC and S-CMC all \nsignificantly lowered inflammatory factor levels, MUC5AC and MUC5B expressions, \nand early and total cell apoptosis rates, and partly reversed the changes in \ncellular ultrastructure and mRNA and protein expressions of the TLR4/NF-\u03baB \npathway, and the effects were the most conspicuous following the combined \ntreatment with high-dose BYF-medicated serum and PDTC.\nCONCLUSIONS: BYF can inhibit cell apoptosis, inflammation and mucus \nhypersecretion in CSE-induced BEAS-2B cells by inhibiting the TLR4/NF-\u03baB \nsignaling pathway.\n\nPublisher: \u76ee\u7684: \u63a2\u8ba8\u8865\u80ba\u76ca\u80be\u65b9\u5bf9\u9999\u70df\u70df\u96fe\u63d0\u53d6\u7269\uff08CSE\uff09\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u4eba\u652f\u6c14\u7ba1\u4e0a\u76aeBEAS-2B\u7ec6\u80de\u635f\u4f24\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u673a\u5236\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5: \n\u4ee5CSE\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684BEAS-2B\u7ec6\u80de\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u7fa7\u7532\u53f8\u5766\uff08S-CMC\uff09\u4e3a\u9633\u6027\u5bf9\u7167\uff0c\u5c06\u7ec6\u80de\u5206\u4e3a\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u3001CSE\u7ec4\u3001\u8865\u80ba\u76ca\u80be\u65b9\uff08BYF\uff09\u542b\u836f\u8840\u6e05\u4f4e\u5242\u91cf\uff08BYL\uff09\u7ec4\u3001BYF\u9ad8\u5242\u91cf\uff08BYH\uff09\u7ec4\u3001NF-\u03baB\u6291\u5236\u5242PDTC\u7ec4\u3001BYH+PDTC\u7ec4\u53caS-CMC\u7ec4\u3002CCK-8\u6cd5\u7b5b\u9009CSE\u6700\u4f73\u9020\u6a21\u6d53\u5ea6\u3001\u4f5c\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u53caBYF\u542b\u836f\u8840\u6e05\u3001S-CMC\u7ed9\u836f\u6d53\u5ea6\uff1bELISA\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ec6\u80de\u4e0a\u6e05\u708e\u75c7\u56e0\u5b50\u6c34\u5e73\u53ca\u7ec6\u80deMUC5AC\u3001MUC5B\u8868\u8fbe\uff1b\u900f\u5c04\u7535\u955c\u89c2\u5bdf\u7ec6\u80de\u8d85\u5fae\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u6d41\u5f0f\u7ec6\u80de\u672f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ec6\u80de\u51cb\u4ea1\u7387\uff1bqRT-PCR\u53caWestern \nblotting\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ec6\u80deTLR4/NF-\u03baB\u901a\u8def\u76f8\u5173mRNA\u548c\u86cb\u767d\u8868\u8fbe\u3002\u7ed3\u679c: \n\u4e0eControl\u7ec4\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cCSE\u7ec4\u7ec6\u80deIL-1\u03b2\u3001IL-6\u53caTNF-\u03b1\u7684\u5206\u6ccc\u5347\u9ad8\uff08P<0.01\uff09\uff0c\u7ec6\u80deMUC5AC\u3001MUC5B \nmRNA\u548c\u86cb\u767d\u8868\u8fbe\u5347\u9ad8\uff08P<0.01\uff09\uff0c\u7ec6\u80de\u51fa\u73b0\u51cb\u4ea1\u5c0f\u4f53\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u51cb\u4ea1\u7387\u53ca\u603b\u51cb\u4ea1\u7387\u5347\u9ad8\uff08P<0.01\uff09\uff0c\u7ec6\u80deTLR4\uff0cI-\u03baB\uff0cNF-\u03baB \nmRNA\u548c\u86cb\u767d\u8868\u8fbe\u5347\u9ad8\uff08P<0.01\uff09\uff0cAQP5 \nmRNA\u548c\u86cb\u767d\u8868\u8fbe\u964d\u4f4e\uff08P<0.01\uff09\u3002\u4e0eCSE\u7ec4\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5404\u7ed9\u836f\u7ec4\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u7ec6\u80de\u4e0a\u6e05\u708e\u75c7\u56e0\u5b50\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u7ec6\u80deMUC5AC\u3001MUC5B \nmRNA\u548c\u86cb\u767d\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u7ec6\u80de\u65e9\u671f\u51cb\u4ea1\u7387\u53ca\u603b\u51cb\u4ea1\u7387\uff0c\u7ec6\u80de\u8d85\u5fae\u7ed3\u6784\u635f\u4f24\u53caTLR4/NF-\u03baB\u901a\u8def\u76f8\u5173mRNA\u548c\u86cb\u767d\u8868\u8fbe\u88ab\u90e8\u5206\u9006\u8f6c\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4ee5BYH+PDTC\u7ec4\u66f4\u660e\u663e\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba: \n\u8865\u80ba\u76ca\u80be\u65b9\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6291\u5236TLR4/NF-\u03baB\u4fe1\u53f7\u901a\u8def\u6291\u5236CSE\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684BEAS-2B\u7ec6\u80de\u51cb\u4ea1\u3001\u708e\u75c7\u548c\u9ecf\u6db2\u9ad8\u5206\u6ccc\u3002.\n\nDOI: 10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2025.07.03\nPMCID: PMC12268926\nPMID: 40673299 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no competing interests.\n\n\n34.

This study aims to evaluate the efficiency of a novel laser \nsystems (LGS)-assisted CT-guided percutaneous lung biopsy in COPD patients with \npulmonary nodules.\nMETHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the data of 60 COPD patients \nwith pulmonary nodules. Thirty patients (n=30) underwent CT-guided percutaneous \ntransthoracic lung biopsy assisted by LGS, while the remaining 30 (n=30) \nunderwent conventional manual CT-guided percutaneous transthoracic lung biopsy. \nThe surgical time, number of punctures, CT scan frequency, and complications \nwere compared between the two groups.\nRESULTS: No significant differences were found between the two groups in terms \nof clinical characteristics, lesion size, location, puncture depth, or nodule \nnature. Compared to the traditional method, LGS-assisted CT-guided percutaneous \nlung biopsy significantly reduced the number of CT scans (2.3 \u00b1 0.5 vs 3.2 \u00b1 \n0.6, P < 0.001) and the average procedure time (12.6 \u00b1 2.7 min vs 25.1 \u00b1 3.4 \nmin, P < 0.001). Additionally, the total intraoperative time per procedure was \nsignificantly reduced (25.1 \u00b1 3.4 min vs 45.9 \u00b1 8.8 min, P < 0.001). With the \nuse of LGS, 73% (22/30) of the procedures hit the target on the first needle \ninsertion, compared to only 6.7% (2/30) in the conventional group. Furthermore, \nthere was no significant difference in the incidence of complications between \nthe two groups.\nCONCLUSION: Compared to the traditional method, the use of LGS improved puncture \nefficiency in COPD patients, reduced the need for needle adjustments, and \neffectively shortened the procedure time.\n\n\u00a9 2025 Li et al.\n\nDOI: 10.2147/COPD.S530756\nPMCID: PMC12266053\nPMID: 40672057 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflicts of interest in \nthis work.\n\n\n35.

Adults with asthma were recruited via email, enrolled from \nOctober 29, 2020, through November 4, 2021, and were randomized to DASM or usual \ncare (control). Participants completed study activities outside a clinical \nsetting. Data were analyzed between October 13, 2023, and November 29, 2024.\nINTERVENTION: The app-based DASM program provided tailored notifications, \nsymptom logging, wearable device integration, and other tools.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Change in the Asthma Control Test (ACT) was a \nprimary outcome. The ACT is a validated measure of asthma control. Secondary \noutcomes included engagement and self-reported medication adherence.\nRESULTS: Nine hundred and one participants were enrolled, with data available \nfor 899 (639 [71.1%] female; mean [SD] age, 36.6 [10.5] years). For subgroup \nanalyses, 195 participants (21.7%) were African American; 125 (13.9%), Hispanic \nor Latino; 680 (75.6%), commercially insured; and 219 (24.4%), Medicaid insured. \nPrespecified analyses of participants with uncontrolled asthma at baseline \n(n\u2009=\u2009550) showed improvements after 12 months by 4.6 (95% CI, 4.1-5.2) ACT \npoints among DASM participants (P\u2009<\u2009.001) and 1.8 (95% CI, 1.3-2.4) ACT points \namong controls (P\u2009<\u2009.001) (adjusted difference, 2.8 [95% CI, 2.0-3.6] points; \nP\u2009<\u2009.001). Race moderated this effect. At 12 months, the difference between arms \nin ACT change favored DASM over control by 1.0 (95% CI, -0.7 to 2.7) points \n(P\u2009=\u2009.26) for African American participants and 3.3 (95% CI, 2.4-4.2) points \n(P\u2009<\u2009.001) for participants not endorsing African American race (adjusted \ndifference, -2.3 [95% CI, -4.2 to -0.4] points; P\u2009=\u2009.02 for interaction). \nModeration was not observed by insurance (Medicaid vs commercial; adjusted \ndifference, 1.0 [95% CI, -0.8 to 2.8] points; P\u2009=\u2009.18 for interaction) or \nethnicity (Hispanic or Latino vs non-Hispanic; adjusted difference, 1.0 [95% CI, \n-1.3 to 3.3] points; P\u2009=\u2009.70 for interaction).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial of DASM, improved \nasthma control was observed relative to usual care. Program adaptations may be \nappropriate to confer benefit throughout diverse populations.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04609644.\n\nDOI: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.21438\nPMID: 40674052 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n36.

The combination ipratropium/salbutamol gives more bronchodilation \nthan ipratropium monotherapy in asthma/COPD exacerbations, but there are \nconcerns about cardiac safety of salbutamol. Salbutamol in regular dosage does \nnot affect heart rate in diverse populations (ED, ICU and children). Only a \ndosage 5-10x the standard dosage of 2,5 mg leads to a 20-30-beat increase in \nheart rate. High-dose salbutamol induced a mild increase of QTc interval (\u00b1360 \nto \u00b1390ms) and QTc dispersion (maximum minus minimum QTc; marker for \nsusceptibility to arrhythmia), but not to a clinically relevant extent. Most \nimportantly, literature shows that the incidence of arrhythmia is similar \nbetween salbutamol and placebo. Salbutamol did not induce severe arrhythmias, \nincluding in arrhythmogenic ICU populations or in patients with severe COPD with \ncardiac comorbidity. We therefore argue that the current caution exercised with \nthe use ipratropium/salbutamol is unjustified. Treatment should not be withheld \nin case of tachycardia or underlying heart disease.\n\nPMID: 40673353 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n37.

In turn, the \nactivation of some TLRs stimulates epithelial cells to release inflammatory \ncytokines, exacerbating Th2-driven inflammation and contributing to airway \nremodeling. Certain TLR signals help inhibit allergic responses by inducing type \nI interferon or regulatory T cells. The TLR family comprises 10 members, each \nresponsible for recognizing the distinct molecular structure of multiple \nmicrobial sources. Variations in environmental microbial exposure duration and \nhost genetic background contribute to the complexity of the TLR signaling \nnetwork during asthma development. In recent years, therapeutic strategies \ntargeting TLRs have shown potential for asthma treatment. However, a \ncomprehensive review of TLRs in asthma is lacking. Therefore, this review sought \nto examine the functional mechanisms of TLRs and associated signaling cascades \nin asthma, and explore novel prevention and treatment approaches centered on \nTLRs modulation.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Xu, Yu, Yang, Li, Xiong and Li.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1605185\nPMCID: PMC12263361\nPMID: 40672946 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n39.

The biological \npathway enrichment analysis revealed that the upregulated genes were mainly \ninvolved in glycosylation processes, whereas the downregulated genes were mainly \nassociated with immune cell differentiation process. The gene co-expression \nnetwork analysis revealed that module 9, enriched in glycosylation-related \npathways, was significantly positively correlated with asthma, whereas module \n17, associated with insulin and other signaling pathways, showed a significant \nnegative correlation with asthma. We identified the genes of polypeptide \nN-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 5 (GALNT5), pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase \n1 (PYCR1), and carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 \n(CEACAM5) as key genes within module 9, all of which were significantly \nupregulated in asthma. Finally, we validated that the expression levels of \nGALNT5, PYCR1, and CEACAM5 were significantly upregulated in epithelial cells \nfrom asthmatic lung tissue. Additionally, using a rat asthma model, we further \nconfirmed that the protein levels of these three genes were significantly \nupregulated in lung tissues of the model group. Conclusion Through data \nintegration and experimental validation, this study identified key genes and \nbiological pathways closely associated with asthma pathogenesis. These findings \nprovide a novel theoretical basis and potential targets for the diagnosis and \ntreatment of asthma.\n\nPMID: 40670133 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n40.

Data of \nadult patients with allergic diseases was extracted from the 3 EHR systems \noperating across the participating sites using standardized Structured Query \nLanguage queries across the 3 systems. We computed the prevalence of allergic \ndiseases among adults who consulted in primary care health facilities by \ndividing the number of patients diagnosed to have an allergic disease over the \ntotal number of adult patients who consulted within the 3-year study period. We \ncompared the quality of care of patients across the 3 sites based on clinical \npractice guidelines using Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, or 1-way \nanalysis of variance, as appropriate.\nRESULTS: The prevalence of allergic disease among adults who consulted in \nprimary care health facilities was 1.3% for the urban site, 2.2% for the rural \nsite, and 2.1% for the remote site. The most common allergic disease was asthma \n(59.0%). First-line medications based on recommendations in clinical practice \nguidelines were prescribed more often in the urban site, including inhaled \ncorticosteroids with long-acting beta-agonists for asthma patients (P\u2009<\u2009.001) \nand topical corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis (P\u2009<\u2009.001). In contrast, there \nwas more frequent prescription of medications that were not recommended in \nclinical practice guidelines in the rural and remote sites.\nCONCLUSION: Health inequity was observed in this study, with results \ndemonstrating that the rural and remote sites had greater allergic disease \nprevalence, greater underutilization of first-line medications, and more \nfrequent overutilization of non-essential medications.\n\nDOI: 10.1177/21501319251353599\nPMCID: PMC12268130\nPMID: 40668119 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe \nauthor(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the \nresearch, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\n\n41.

This nationwide, open cohort study conducted in Sweden from 1997 to 2018 \nincluded asthma patients of all ages (n\u2009=\u20091,051,240) to assess their subsequent \nrisk of developing T2DM. The study compared asthma patients residing in highly \ndeprived neighborhoods with those living in moderately or less deprived areas \n(reference group). Cox proportional hazards regression models were employed to \nanalyze the association between neighborhood deprivation and T2DM incidence, \nwith results expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% \nCIs). Analyses were stratified by sex and adjusted for potential confounders. A \nsignificant association between neighborhood deprivation and T2DM risk in asthma \npatients was shown. These associations remained statistically significant after \nadjusting for confounders, with adjusted HRs of 1.44 (95% CI 1.38-1.50) for men \nand 1.51 (95% CI 1.46-1.57) for women. Furthermore, a graded relationship was \nobserved, with higher levels of neighborhood deprivation associated with an \nincreased incidence of T2DM among asthma patients. These findings underscore \ncritical clinical and public health concerns. The results of this study provide \nvaluable insights for policymakers, highlighting the need to consider \nneighborhood deprivation when allocating resources in primary healthcare \nsettings. They also offer guidance for optimizing clinical care strategies for \npatients in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

The objective \nof this study is to examine the association between FA and mental health in \nchildren and adolescents, compared to children and adolescents without FA \n(controls) and those with other chronic conditions but no history of FA. This is \na retrospective cohort study using IQVIA Medical Research Data from UK primary \ncare practices. Five cohorts of children aged 0-18 between 2000 and 2021 were \ndefined: FA, control, asthma, atopic dermatitis (AD), and type 1 diabetes (T1D). \nThe study included 1,130,721 children without FA (control), 23,263 with FA, \n136,453 with asthma, 207,575 with AD, and 4835 with T1D. Compared to control, FA \npatients had higher risks of eating disorders (hazard ratio (HR) 1.85, 95% CI \n1.42-2.41), anxiety (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.25-1.45), and depression (HR 1.24, 95% CI \n1.11-1.39). FA patients had lower depression risk than asthma and T1D patients \n(HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.68-0.87, 0.64, 95% CI 0.54-0.76, respectively) and lower \nanxiety risk than asthma patients (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79-0.91). FA patients' risk \nof eating disorders was not significantly different from asthma and T1D patients \n(HR 1.17, 95% CI 0.88-1.55, 1.58, 95% CI 0.81-3.10, respectively) but was \nsignificantly higher than in the AD group (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.07-1.90).\nCONCLUSION: This study indicates that children with FA face elevated risks of \nanxiety, depression, and eating disorders compared to children without FA, and \nthat these risks vary when compared to children with other chronic conditions. \nThese findings highlight the need for integrated mental health support in FA \nmanagement and greater awareness of FA's psychological impact among healthcare \nproviders.\nWHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022 Children with chronic illnesses such as asthma\u00a0and\u00a0diabetes are \nknown to have an elevated risk of mental health disorders. However, research on \nthe mental health impact of food allergies remains limited.\nWHAT IS NEW: \u2022 This study reveals that children with FA have significantly \nincreased risks of anxiety, depression, and eating disorders compared to \nchildren without FA and provides comparative insights into the mental health \nrisks of FA relative to other chronic conditions like asthma, atopic dermatitis, \ntype 1 diabetes, and healthy controls.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Early detection of WRA could prevent poor \nhealth and employment outcomes, but clinical diagnosis is often missed or \ndelayed. The standardisation and effectiveness of screening tools have not been \nwell established. We aimed to summarise and compare the performance of screening \ntools for identifying WRA in both clinical settings and workplaces.\nMETHODS: We searched for studies that used structured questionnaires or \nprediction models (with/without physiological tests) to identify WRA in clinical \nsettings or workplaces with individuals aged\u226516\u2009years in MEDLINE, Embase, other \nbibliographic databases and grey literature between 1975 and 2024. Two reviewers \nindependently screened titles, abstracts and full texts for inclusion, extracted \ndata and assessed risk of bias using QUADAS-2 tool (Quality Assessment of \nDiagnostic Test Accuracy 2) or PROBAST (Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment \nTool). Screening tools and their indices of accuracy were summarised with paired \nforest plots of sensitivities and specificities.\nRESULTS: Of 17\u2009504 identified studies, 7 were included. All were implemented in \ntertiary hospitals (n=5) and specialist centres (n=2). The screening tools \ncomprised questionnaires alone (individual questions n=3 and multiple questions \nn=2), questionnaire with methacholine challenge test (n=1) and diagnostic models \n(n=4). The question 'improvement off work' had sensitivity=74-87%\u2009and \nspecificity=15-58% for identifying WRA. Multiple questions had \nsensitivity=80-100% and specificity=8-55%. Addition of the methacholine \nchallenge test to one questionnaire improved specificity to 75% with \nsensitivity=65%. Diagnostic models reported area under the curve (AUC) between \n0.69 and 0.89, and AUC was improved when adding demographic variables or \nobjective tests.\nDISCUSSION: A single item 'improvement off work' and multiple questions have \nhigh sensitivity but low specificity for WRA, which are sufficient for screening \npurposes to enhance WRA diagnosis. Adding demographic variables and objective \ntests can improve specificity or AUC. However, studies on screening tools for \nWRA are limited and inadequately reported; further evaluations of performance \nare needed in primary care populations and workplaces.\nPROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42021246031.\n\n\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

Recent studies suggest an \nassociation between asthma and neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism \nspectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). \nSensory processing disorder (SPD), a neurodevelopmental condition characterized \nby atypical responses to sensory stimuli, may also be linked to asthma through \nshared inflammatory mechanisms.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of SPD in children \nwith asthma as compared to those without asthma and explore its relationship \nwith asthma severity.\nMETHODS: This prospective, cross-sectional study included 182 children aged 5-12 \nyears, with 91 asthmatic children in the study group and 91 nonasthmatic \nchildren in the control group. Sensory processing abilities were assessed using \nthe Sensory Processing Measure (SPM) Home-Form. Statistical analyses, including \nlogistic regression and path analysis, were performed to evaluate the \nassociation between asthma and sensory processing abnormalities.\nRESULTS: Atypical sensory processing was significantly more prevalent in \nasthmatic children compared to the control group across multiple sensory \ndomains, including vision, auditory, tactile, body awareness, balance, and \nmovement (p\u2009<\u20090.005). Logistic regression analysis revealed that asthma was \nassociated with increased risk of atypical sensory processing, particularly in \ntactile (OR: 5.716, 95% CI: 2.9-11.3 p\u2009<\u20090.001) and balance/movement (OR: 8.8, \n95% CI: 2.5-30.7, p\u2009=\u20090.001) domains. However, no significant association was \nfound between asthma severity and SPD prevalence.\nCONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that children with asthma exhibit a higher \nprevalence of SPD, supporting the hypothesis that neuroinflammation may \ncontribute to sensory processing abnormalities. These results highlight the need \nfor multidisciplinary approaches in managing asthmatic children, considering \nboth respiratory and neurodevelopmental aspects. Further research is warranted \nto explore underlying mechanisms and potential interventions.\n\n\u00a9 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.\n\nDOI: 10.1002/ppul.71203\nPMID: 40662480 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n45.

This study aims to evaluate DAR for EoE-tx using the FDA Adverse Event \nReporting System. FDA Adverse Event Reporting System was queried for DAR between \n2022Q1 and 2023Q4. Individual DARs (iDARs) were categorized and compared between \ntreatment groups: EoE, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and chronic rhinosinusitis \nwith nasal polyps. Logistic regression was used to predict serious DAR and \noutcomes, and zero-truncated negative binomial regression was used to predict \nthe number of iDAR. There were 51,000 DAR observations; 1459 for EoE-tx with 103 \n(7.1%) serious reactions and 44 (3.0%) serious outcomes including 3 deaths. For \nEoE-tx, the mean iDAR was 3.68 [3.51, 3.85], and the iDAR incidence rate ratio \namong men receiving EoE-tx was 0.73 [0.65, 0.83]. EoE-tx average iDAR primarily \nincluded general (0.75 [0.70, 0.80]), injection-site (0.69 [0.63, 0.74]), \ndermatologic (0.51 [0.46, 0.55]), and gastrointestinal (0.24 [0.21, 0.27]) \nreactions. Adults \u226550\u00a0years had 1.97 [1.28, 2.99] higher odds for serious DAR \ncompared to younger adults in EoE-tx. Overall, dupilumab demonstrated a \nfavorable safety profile across all indications, with low rates of serious \nadverse events. For EoE-tx specifically, higher total iDAR rates were observed, \ndriven largely by increased injection-site and gastrointestinal reactions \ncompared to other indications. Additionally, women exhibited higher iDAR rates \nthan men across all indications.\n\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2025.

The mechanism by which \ndysregulated circRNAs affect severe asthma by regulating macrophage polarization \nremains unclear.\nMETHODS: High-throughput RNA sequencing technology was used to analyze circRNA \nexpression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with \nsevere asthma. RT-qPCR and ELISA were used to analyze the expression of \ninflammatory factors in a mouse model of severe asthma induced by \novalbumin-lipopolysaccharide. The effect of circ-0001875 on macrophage \nactivation and the underlying mechanism were analyzed by RT-qPCR, Western blot, \nand ELISA. Subsequently, the regulatory relationships among circ-0001875, \nmiR-31-5p, and SP1 were examined through dual luciferase reporter gene assay, \nand the mechanism by which they regulate macrophage polarization was analyzed by \nWestern blot.\nRESULTS: Compared with the healthy control group, 420 circRNAs were \ndifferentially expressed in PBMCs from patients with severe asthma. Among them, \ncirc-0001875, which was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm of monocytes, was \nsignificantly downregulated in asthmatics, especially those with severe disease. \ncirc-0001875 overexpression inhibited M1 macrophage activation in vitro and \nalleviated lung inflammation in a mouse model of severe asthma. Mechanistically, \ncirc-0001875 promoted SP1 translation by competitively binding to miR-31-5p, \nthereby reducing its inhibitory effect on SP1 translation; SP1 then inhibited M1 \nmacrophage polarization, which is associated with severe asthma, through the \nNF-\u03baB signaling pathway.\nCONCLUSIONS: We found that circ-0001875 plays an important role in regulating M1 \nmacrophage polarization, which is associated with a severe pro-inflammatory \nresponse.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Liu, Cao, Lin, Long, Su, Qiu, Jiang, Wang, Zhao, Huang and Wu.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1601272\nPMCID: PMC12256210\nPMID: 40661956 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
