Therefore, we investigated HPV58 \ndetection rates and E6/E7 allele frequency trends, and analyzed the positive \nselection, viral load, pathogenicity, and persistent infection capacity \nassociated with specific genotypes/mutations using 239\u2009743 exfoliated cervical \ncell samples. Our results show a gradual increase in HPV58 detection rates over \ntime. Allele replacement occurs slowly, with significant changes manifesting \nafter long-term accumulation. The E6 A388C(K93N)\u2009+\u2009E7 prototype enhanced \nshort-term persistent infection capacity without increasing high-grade lesion \npathogenicity, and its frequency increased. Conversely, E7 C632T (T20I) and \nG760A (G63S) mutations enhanced high-grade lesion pathogenicity, whereas G761A \n(G63D) reduced pathogenicity. HPV58 improves adaptive ability by increasing the \npersistent infection capacity without increasing the risk of high-grade lesions. \nHigh viral load was positively correlated with both pathogenicity and persistent \ninfection capacity, suggesting its potential as a risk factor for predicting \ndisease progression in HPV58 screening. No correlation was observed between \nHPV58 viral load and specific gene mutations/genotypes, indicating that \nalternative mechanisms likely drive allele replacement. This study provides \ninsights to optimize HPV58 screening strategies and deepen understanding of its \nevolutionary dynamics.\n\n\u00a9 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.\n\nDOI: 10.1002/jmv.70502\nPMID: 40677200 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n2.

In recent years, due to the change in the requirements of \ninfectious disease prevention and control, the research focus has expanded from \ncommon infectious diseases to diseases which have been eliminated or might be \neliminated, as well as emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Infectious \ndisease data has been characterized by multiple sources and modalities. Along \nwith the rapid development of pathogen detection methods, infectious disease \nsurveillance has shifted from a single disease-targted one to a comprehensive \none. Moreover, novel technologies such as multi-omics and artificial \nintelligence have been applied in infectious disease epidemiology research. The \ninternational cooperation in this field has become increasingly crucial, and the \nrevision of the International Health Regulations and the negotiation of pandemic \nagreement will have a profound impact.

Methods: A cross-sectional study design was used in this questionnaire \nsurvey in young MSM recurited through local MSM social organization in Hangzhou \nfrom September 2022 to March 2023. The estimated sample size was 242. The \ninformation about the social-demographic characteristics, behavioral \ncharacteristics, utilization of the post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) service, \nawareness and utilization of PrEP service of the young MSM were collected. \nLogistic regression model was used to analyze the related factors of the PrEP \nutilization.

Notably, \nMSM aged \u226530 years and MSM who had occasional condoms use at each sex in the \npast three months were more likely to recommend self-HIV testing to other MSM. \nThe 53 MSM collectively recommended self-HIV testing to another 740 MSM, the \naverage was 13.9 MSM recommended by 1 MSM. Among MSM who accepted \nrecommendation, 3 HIV-positive cases were identified, indicating that 1 HIV \ninfection was detected by 17.7 recommendations. In the four-round \nrecommendation, 10 MSM participated in more than one round recommendation, all \nof them were HIV prevention volunteers. Others only participating in one round \nwere common MSM. Eleven MSM recommended self-HIV testing to two or more MSM. \nConclusions: Peer-recommendation has high efficiency in the promotion of \nself-HIV testing, with HIV prevention volunteers serving as the primary force \nand the common MSM acting as a supportive force. Future efforts should be made \nto fully use key individuals to promote self-HIV testing.\n\nPublisher: \u76ee\u7684\uff1a \u4e86\u89e3MSM\u63a8\u8350\u540c\u4f34HIV\u81ea\u6211\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08\u81ea\u68c0\uff09\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522b\u63a8\u8350\u540c\u4f34HIV\u81ea\u68c0\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4eba\u7269\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u4f9d\u636e\u3002 \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a \n\u4f9d\u62582022\u5e747\u67081\u65e5\u81f32024\u5e745\u670831\u65e5\u77f3\u5bb6\u5e84\u5e02MSM\u793e\u4f1a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u540c\u884c\u5de5\u4f5c\u7ec4\u8fd0\u884c\u7684HIV\u81ea\u68c0\u8bd5\u5242\u7533\u9886\u7cfb\u7edf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528SPSS \n29.0\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ec4\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u91c7\u7528\u03c72\u68c0\u9a8c\u3002\u4f7f\u7528yEd Graph Editor 3.24\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u8350\u7f51\u7edc\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5206\u6790\u3002 \u7ed3\u679c\uff1a \n\u7533\u9886HIV\u81ea\u68c0\u8bd5\u5242\u7684MSM\u51711 \n574\u540d\uff0c\u7533\u9886\u8005\u4ee5\u672a\u5a5a\uff0874.7%\uff09\u3001\u4e13\u79d1\u53ca\u4ee5\u4e0a\u6587\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0865.5%\uff09\u3001\u5728\u804c\u4eba\u5458\uff0853.2%\uff09\u4e3a\u4e3b\uff0c\u6700\u8fd13\u4e2a\u6708\u53d1\u751f\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u6b21\u90fd\u7528\u5b89\u5168\u5957\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e3a54.8%\uff08862/1 \n574\uff09\uff0c\u4e0a\u4f20HIV\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e3a37.2%\uff08585/1 \n574\uff09\u3002\u63a8\u8350\u540c\u4f34HIV\u81ea\u68c0\u7684MSM\u517153\u540d\uff083.4%\uff09\uff0c\u5e74\u9f84\u7ec4\u4e3a\u226530\u5c81\u3001\u6700\u8fd13\u4e2a\u6708\u53d1\u751f\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u65f6\u6709\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u5b89\u5168\u5957\u7684MSM\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u63a8\u8350\u540c\u4f34\u81ea\u68c0\u300253\u540dMSM\u5171\u63a8\u8350740\u540d\u540c\u4f34\u81ea\u68c0\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6bcf\u4eba\u63a8\u835013.9\u540d\u3002\u7ecf\u63a8\u8350\u540c\u4f34\u81ea\u68c0\u53d1\u73b0HIV\u9633\u60273\u540d\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6bcf17.7\u540d\u63a8\u8350\u8005\u53d1\u73b01\u540dHIV\u611f\u67d3\u8005\u3002\u57284\u8f6e\u63a8\u8350\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u51fa\u73b0\u4e0d\u6b62\u4e00\u8f6e\u7684MSM\u517110\u540d\uff0c\u5747\u4e3a\u827e\u6ecb\u75c5\u9632\u6cbb\u5fd7\u613f\u8005\uff1b\u5176\u4ed6\u53ea\u51fa\u73b0\u4e00\u8f6e\u7684\u5747\u4e3a\u666e\u901aMSM\uff0c\u670911\u540dMSM\u63a8\u8350\u540c\u4f34HIV\u81ea\u68c0\u4eba\u6570\u22652\u540d\u3002 \n\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a \nMSM\u63a8\u8350\u540c\u4f34HIV\u81ea\u68c0\u6548\u7387\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u4ee5\u827e\u6ecb\u75c5\u9632\u6cbb\u5fd7\u613f\u8005\u4e3a\u4e3b\u4f53\u529b\u91cf\u3001\u666e\u901aMSM\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u529b\u91cf\u7684\u5c40\u9762\u3002\u540e\u7eed\u5e94\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u6325\u5173\u952e\u4eba\u7269\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdbHIV\u81ea\u68c0\u7684\u5b9e\u65bd\u3002.\n\nDOI: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20241218-00812\nPMID: 40677190 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n6.

The \ndynamic nature of infectious diseases, especially those that also rely on \ncarriers (e.g., house flies) for transmission, requires innovative strategies to \ncontrol their spread, as environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, \netc., affect the rate of growth of the carrier population. This study introduces \na mathematical model to assess the effect of increasing global average \ntemperature rise caused by carbon dioxide emissions and chemical control \nstrategies on the dynamics of such diseases. The stability properties of \nfeasible equilibrium solutions were discussed. Sensitivity analysis was also \nperformed to highlight the key parameters that may help to design effective \nintervention strategies to control disease transmission. The model was further \nanalyzed for an optimal control problem by incorporating a control measure on \nthe application rate of chemical insecticides to reduce the carrier population. \nThrough the combination of analytical techniques and numerical simulations, we \nhave evaluated the effectiveness of chemical control strategies under varying \nepidemiological parameters. The model also explored the critical thresholds \nnecessary for achieving disease control and eradication. Our results are \nvaluable to public health officials and policymakers in designing effective \ninterventions against carrier-dependent infectious diseases.\n\nDOI: 10.3934/mbe.2025063\nPMID: 40676991 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n7.

The eradication time is defined as the earliest time the infectious \npopulation falls below a prescribed threshold and remains below it. Leveraging \nthe fact that this problem reduces to solving a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) \nequation, we propose a mesh-free framework based on a physics-informed neural \nnetwork to approximate the solution. Moreover, leveraging the well-known \nstructure of the optimal control of the problem, we efficiently obtain the \noptimal vaccination control from the minimum eradication time using the dynamic \nprogramming principle. To improve training stability and accuracy, we \nincorporate a variable scaling method and provide theoretical justification \nthrough a neural tangent kernel analysis. Numerical experiments show that this \ntechnique significantly enhances convergence, reducing the mean squared residual \nerror by approximately 80% compared with standard physics-informed approaches. \nFurthermore, the method accurately identifies the optimal switching time. These \nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed deep learning framework as \na computational tool for solving optimal control problems in epidemic modeling \nas well as the corresponding HJB equations.\n\nDOI: 10.3934/mbe.2025059\nPMID: 40676987 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n8.

In Canada, HPV vaccination \nis publicly funded, yet uptake has not consistently reached coverage targets. \nMedia reporting on the perspectives of religious leaders may impact vaccine \nbehavior; however, there has been limited exploration of media depictions of \nreligious perspectives of HPV vaccination in Canada. This study examined the \ncontent and tone of news media's depiction of religion and HPV vaccination in \nCanada. To identify news reports for our content analysis, we searched Canadian \nNewsstream, Global Newsstream, and Factiva for English language news articles \nbetween 2006 and 2024. Published articles covered a 13-year period (2006-2018); \nno articles were found between 2019 and 2024. We coded 333 articles for: (1) \npublication information, (2) article tone, (3) description of religious leaders' \nor members' views toward HPV vaccination, (4) voices represented, and (5) HPV \nvaccination content reported. Most articles adopted a neutral (72%) or positive \n(23%) tone toward HPV vaccination. Most articles (97%) focused on Catholic \nperspectives, with minimal inclusion of other faiths. The most frequently quoted \nvoices in the articles were from school board trustees or administrators (46%), \nreligious leaders (45%), and healthcare professionals (43%). In the articles, \nmedical professionals (68%) and community leaders (45%) were frequently cited as \nendorsing the HPV vaccine, while religious leaders were less often cited as \nendorsing vaccination (14%). Support for the vaccine by religious leaders or \nmembers primarily focused on disease prevention, while opposition often centered \non concerns about promoting sexual activity and misalignment with religious \nvalues. As HPV vaccination policies evolve, including endorsement from \ninterfaith leaders and other stakeholders may be important for inclusive health \njournalism, accurate portrayal of wide-ranging religious perspectives, and the \npublic health priority to increase HPV vaccination.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/21645515.2025.2530290\nPMID: 40676985 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n9.

Each sex is further split \ninto compartments of susceptible, infected/infectious, and recovered/immune \nindividuals, with constant per capita recovery and loss of immunity rates, while \nthe per capita infection rates for each sex (force of infection) are based on \nstandard incidence terms corresponding to the probabilities that the sexual \npartner of each sex that a susceptible individual randomly selects is an \ninfected one. We explored possible effects of behavioral interventions, such as \ncondom usage and reducing the number of sexual partnerships as well as the \ndifferent dynamics of STI transmission between populations engaging solely in \nopposite-sex interactions and those engaging in non-opposite-sex interactions. \nThese findings can help inform the development of public health policies aimed \nat alleviating the burden of sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nDOI: 10.3934/mbe.2025053\nPMID: 40676979 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n10.

Given the global \nincrease in the prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria, this study focuses \non secondary colistin resistance in clinically significant gram-negative \nnon-fermenting bacteria Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and \nStenotrophomonas maltophilia at the University Hospital Olomouc in 2018-2023. \nAccording to the results of the present study, the prevalence of \ncolistin-resistant isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa \nand Stenotrophomonas maltophilia at the hospital was 1 %, 2 % and 45 %, \nrespectively, with none of the species showing an increasing trend over the \nsix-year period. Additionally, no increase in the prevalence of \nmultidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant isolates was observed in \ncolistin-resistant gram-negative non-fermenting bacteria. The highest proportion \nof colistin-resistant Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains was detected in \ndepartments providing the highest level of acute intensive care, which \ncorrelates with the nature of these facilities. Colistin consumption peaked in \nthe COVID-19 year 2021, but returned to its original level by the end of the \nstudy period. In the selected set of colistin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa \nisolates, no plasmid-mediated mcr 1-5 genes were detected. A significant finding \nwas the detection of clonal spread of colistin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa \nstrains between acute admission and intensive care units, em-phasizing the need \nfor strict adherence to preventive measures in these departments.\n\nPMID: 40678880 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n12.

Due to its multidrug resistance, A. baumannii has emerged \nas a key monitored pathogen of WHO for surveillance in healthcare settings, \nparticularly in intensive care units (ICUs).\nMETHODS: To identify factors associated with A. baumannii infection in Guizhou \nprovince, China from 2015 to 2023, a retrospective cross-sectional analysis was \ncarried out with the data from hospital records, electronic medical databases. \nFisher's exact test (gender) and Chi-square were used for statistical tests, \nwhile p-values was used to define the statistically significance of variables.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Out of 460,620 patients; there were 6,944 positive \ninfection events, with ICU-related infections accounting for 45.77%. Males had a \nsignificantly higher risk of A. baumannii infection compared to females, and \nhost factors such as gender and increasing age were associated with greater \nsusceptibility. In addition, infection rates were higher during warmer summer \nmonths, suggesting a possible seasonal trend in transmission. Within the \npopulation undergoing antibiotic therapy, only polymyxin B demonstrated an \nalarmingly high level of resistance, whereas other clinically employed \nantibiotics were invalid. In summary, the statistical data from these years \nemphasizes that gender and age are main drivers of A. baumannii outbreaks in \nGuizhou, and follow-up public health interventions need to target these factors \nto enhance infection control and reduce the spread. Also, the observation of \nhigh levels of resistance to multiple antibiotics is a matter of concern, as it \npresents significant challenges in terms of treatment.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Liang, Tian, Huang, Dou, Yang and Chen.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fpubh.2025.1592783\nPMCID: PMC12267245\nPMID: 40678652 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n13.

However, the \npatterns of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) spread over time and space in \nShijiazhuang remain poorly understood. This study aims to clarify the \nspatio-temporal dynamics of PTB transmission in this region.\nMETHODS: We conducted a retrospective study using PTB surveillance data from \n2010 to 2023, extracted from the national Tuberculosis Information Management \nSystem. Descriptive epidemiological analysis was conducted to assess the \nseverity and distribution characteristics of PTB in Shijiazhuang. The Joinpoint \nregression model was employed to analyze the annual temporal trends. Spatial \nautocorrelation analysis and Space-time scan analysis were utilized to explore \nthe spatio-temporal clustering characteristics.\nRESULTS: From 2010 to 2023, a total of 54,855 PTB cases were reported, with an \naverage annual incidence of 38.97 per 100,000 population. Males, older adults, \nand farmers were disproportionately affected. The overall incidence declined \nsignificantly (AAPC\u202f=\u202f-7.65%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05), with a steeper drop between 2010 to \n2013 and a more gradual decline thereafter. Spatial analysis revealed persistent \nhigh-high clusters in rural counties such as Lingshou county and Pingshan \ncounty, and low-low clusters in central urban districts. The phased space-time \nscan analysis results identified 19 clusters.\nCONCLUSION: This study reveals a declining PTB incidence in Shijiazhuang, with a \nhigher burden among males, older adults, and farmers, alongside persistent \nspatial clusters in rural areas, particularly in the north. These findings \nemphasize the need for targeted interventions and strengthened rural \nsurveillance to achieve tuberculosis elimination goals.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Wang, Guo, Shi and Cui.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fpubh.2025.1621695\nPMCID: PMC12267174\nPMID: 40678650 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n14.

Some \ninteractions influence platelet aggregation, granule secretion, pro-inflammatory \ncytokine release, and thrombo-inflammatory responses, while others only mediate \nbacterial survival. By focusing on strain-specific mechanisms, this review \nprovides an understanding of the different strategies employed by bacteria to \nmanipulate platelet functions. These insights may aid in developing targeted \ntherapeutic interventions to mitigate platelet-associated complications during \nbacterial infections.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Alfar and Whiteheart.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1610289\nPMCID: PMC12267223\nPMID: 40677721 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n15.

While historical vaccine development relied \nmostly on trial-and-error, modern approaches have become more directed. By \nleveraging our growing understanding of pathogen biology and immune correlates \nof protection, we can design vaccines in ways that promote protective responses. \nHowever, the complexity of many pathogens (e.g., bacteria and fungi), as well as \nour immune responses against them, continue to present important challenges for \nvaccine development.\nAIM: Here, we demonstrate the utility of the PepSeq platform for highly \nmultiplexed serology to both broadly and finely characterize antibody responses \nagainst complex pathogens, using the bacterium, Burkholderia pseudomallei, as a \ncase study.\nMETHODS: We designed and synthesized three diverse pools of DNA-barcoded \npeptides (i.e., PepSeq libraries) and used them to characterize antibodies \nagainst a variety of B. pseudomallei proteins.\nRESULTS: Epitope-resolved antibody binding profiles were generated for 85 \nindividuals with culture-confirmed melioidosis, 89 US blood bank controls, and 6 \nmonoclonal antibodies. Using these data, we identify novel B cell \nantigens/epitopes and finely characterize the epitopes of three monoclonal \nantibodies against the B. pseudomallei GroEL protein.\nCONCLUSION: Highly multiplexed serology platforms, like PepSeq, enable more \ncomprehensive characterization of antibodies, both polyclonal and monoclonal, \nwhich can aid in the development of vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics, even \nfor pathogens with large, complex genomes.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Elko, Williamson, Green, Gates-Hollingsworth, Nelson, Pandit, \nMead, Allender, Woerle, Mayo, Currie, AuCoin, Altin, Keim, Settles and Ladner.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1605758\nPMCID: PMC12267161\nPMID: 40677719 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n16.

This underscores the urgent \nneed for more effective interventions. Recent studies highlight the potential of \nhost-directed therapy approaches to enhance immune defences against TB. \nAtorvastatin, recognized for both its lipid-lowering properties and its \nimmunomodulatory effects, has emerged as a compelling candidate for \nhost-directed therapy against TB. Here, we investigated the ex vivo efficacy of \natorvastatin in inducing immunomodulatory activities (phagosome maturation, \nautophagy, and apoptosis) and enhancing the mycobacterial killing capacity in \nMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells \n(PBMCs).\nMETHOD: Blood samples from healthy donors were collected for PBMC isolation. \nPBMCs were then treated overnight with or without atorvastatin, followed by \ninfection with Mtb strains (H37Rv, HN878, and CDC1551) to evaluate intracellular \nmycobacterial growth by colony-forming units enumeration. Furthermore, \nco-localization of late endosomal marker (Rab-7), lysosomal markers (Cathepsin-D \nand LAMP-3), and autophagy marker (LC3B) with GFP-Mtb was investigated in \ninfected PBMCs using laser scanning confocal microscopy. Moreover, multiple \napoptotic assays were performed, including the TUNEL assay for DNA \nfragmentation, quantification of caspase-3 activity, and the expression levels \nof the pro-apoptotic gene (Bax) and anti-apoptotic gene (Bcl2).\nRESULTS: Treatment with atorvastatin significantly reduced intracellular \nmycobacterial replication compared to untreated controls in Mtb-infected PBMCs. \nMoreover, atorvastatin enhanced co-localization between Mtb and late endosomal \nmarker (Rab-7), lysosomal markers (Cathepsin-D and LAMP-3), and autophagy marker \n(LC3B) in Mtb-infected PBMCs. Furthermore, atorvastatin robustly promoted \napoptosis in Mtb-infected PBMCs, as demonstrated by TUNEL assay and caspase-3 \nactivation.\nCONCLUSION: Our findings highlight atorvastatin's potential as a crucial \nmodulator of the immune response in Mtb-infected PBMCs, supporting its role in \nhost-directed therapy.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Sabeel, Motaung, Ozturk, Mafu, Wilkinson, Thienemann and Guler.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1597534\nPMCID: PMC12267233\nPMID: 40677706 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n17.

Methods: The \nregistration data of etiologically positive pulmonary TB cases in Shaanxi from \n2015 to 2023 were collected from the tuberculosis subsystem of Chinese Disease \nControl and Prevention Information System. Descriptive method was used to \nanalyze the basic characteristics of the etiologically positive pulmonary TB \ncases. Linear trend \u03c72 test was used to analyze trends in registration rate and \npathogen positive rate. Software SPSS 25.0 was used for statistical analysis. \nSoftware ArcGIS 10.8 was used for global spatial autocorrelation and hotspot \nanalysis to explore spatial clustering of the etiologically positive pulmonary \nTB cases. Software SaTScan 10.0 was used for spatiotemporal scan statistics, and \nsoftware ArcGIS 10.8 was used to visualize the spatiotemporal clustering. \nResults: A total of 64 148 cases of etiologically positive pulmonary TB were \nregistered in Shaanxi from 2015 to 2023, with an average annual registration \nrate of 18.33/100 000. The registration rate and pathgen positive rate all \nshowed upward trends from 2015 to 2023, and the differences were significant \n(the trend \u03c72=4 555.18 and 19 330.43, both P<0.001). Global spatial \nautocorrelation and hotspot analysis showed that the registration rate of \netiologically positive pulmonary TB in Shaanxi from 2017 to 2023 showed a \nspatial clustering. The hotspots were mainly in Zhenba and Xixiang counties of \nHanzhong, six counties (districts) of Ankang, and Yanchuan and Yanchang counties \nof Yan'an. The coldspots were mainly in parts of the Guanzhong area, including \nBaoji, Xi'an, and Xianyang. A total of 4 spatiotemporal clustering areas were \nexplored by spatiotemporal scanning analysis (all P<0.001), in which the \nfirst-level clustering areas covered 17 counties (districts), mainly Zhenping, \nZiyang, Zhenba, in southern Shaanxi from 2019 to 2022, the second-level \nclustering areas covered 6 counties (districts), mainly Yanchuan, Yanchang, \nQingjian, in northern Shaanxi from 2018 to 2021, the third-level clustering \nareas covered 14 counties (districts), mainly Yanta, Chang'an, Jingyang, in \nGuanzhong area from 2018 to 2019, and the fourth-level clustering areas covered \n10 counties (districts) from 2019 to 2021. Conclusions: The registration rate of \nlabortory confirmed pulmonary TB cases in Shaanxi showed an upward trend, with \nobvious differences in spatiotemporal clustering distribution.

Methods: The incidence data of brucellosis in Shandong \nfrom 2004 to 2023 were collected from China Disease Prevention and Control \nInformation System. The annual change percentage (APC) and annual average change \npercentage (AAPC) of the incidence rate were calculated by using Joinpoint \nregression model. A age-period-cohort model was used to analyze changes in \nbrucellosis incidence with age, period, and birth cohort. Results: The average \nannual incidence of brucellosis was 1.76/100 000 in Shandong from 2004 to 2023. \nThe Joinpoint regression analysis results showed that the reported incidence of \nbrucellosis increased by an average of 92.0% and 18.9% each year from 2004 to \n2010 and from 2010 to 2014, respectively, and decreased by an average of 0.2% \neach year from 2014 to 2023. The results of APC model showed that the incidence \nof brucellosis increased first and then decreased with age (\u03c72=176.92, P<0.001), \nand incidence of brucellosis showed slow increase and rapid increase first, then \ndecrease (\u03c72=2 921.03, P<0.001) over time. The risk for brucellosis reached peak \nin 2016 (RR=5.29, 95%CI: 4.96-5.65) and became the lowest in 2006 (RR=0.24, \n95%CI: 0.21-0.28). The incidence increased in later birth cohort (\u03c72=348.88, \nP<0.001), the AAPCs of all the age groups were between 15.0% and 40.0%, and the \nolder the age, the greater the risk (\u03c72=348.77, P<0.001). Conclusions: From 2004 \nto 2023, the reported incidence of brucellosis in Shandong showed a significant \nage-period-cohort effect, which increased first and then decreased, first \nincreased and then decreased with age, increased slowly and rapidly first, then \ndecreased over time, and increased in later birth cohort. It is necessary to \nconduct targeted prevention and control, health education to reduce the risk for \nbrucellosis.\n\nPublisher: \u76ee\u7684\uff1a \u5206\u67902004-2023\u5e74\u5c71\u4e1c\u7701\u5e03\u9c81\u6c0f\u83cc\u75c5\uff08\u5e03\u75c5\uff09\u53d1\u75c5\u8d8b\u52bf\u53ca\u53d1\u75c5\u7387\u968f\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u65f6\u671f\u548c\u51fa\u751f\u961f\u5217\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u5236\u5b9a\u5e03\u75c5\u9632\u63a7\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002 \n\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a \n\u6536\u96c62004-2023\u5e74\u4e2d\u56fd\u75be\u75c5\u9884\u9632\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u606f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f20\u67d3\u75c5\u62a5\u544a\u4fe1\u606f\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u5c71\u4e1c\u7701\u5e03\u75c5\u53d1\u75c5\u7387\u8d44\u6599\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Joinpoint\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d1\u75c5\u7387\u7684\u5e74\u53d8\u5316\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\uff08APC\uff09\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u5e74\u53d8\u5316\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\uff08AAPC\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5e74\u9f84-\u65f6\u671f-\u961f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u5e03\u75c5\u53d1\u75c5\u7387\u968f\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u65f6\u671f\u548c\u51fa\u751f\u961f\u5217\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002 \n\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a \n2004-2023\u5e74\u5c71\u4e1c\u7701\u5e03\u75c5\u5e74\u5747\u62a5\u544a\u53d1\u75c5\u7387\u4e3a1.76/10\u4e07\uff0cJoinpoint\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5e03\u75c5\u62a5\u544a\u53d1\u75c5\u73872004-2010\u5e74\u30012010-2014\u5e74\u5e73\u5747\u6bcf\u5e74\u4e0a\u534792.0%\u300118.9%\uff0c2014-2023\u5e74\u5e73\u5747\u6bcf\u5e74\u4e0b\u964d0.2%\u3002APC\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5e03\u75c5\u53d1\u75c5\u7387\u968f\u5e74\u9f84\u589e\u957f\u5448\u5148\u4e0a\u5347\u540e\u4e0b\u964d\u8d8b\u52bf\uff08\u03c72=176.92\uff0cP<0.001\uff09\uff0c\u65f6\u671f\u53d8\u5316\u4e2d\u53d1\u75c5\u7387\u968f\u65f6\u671f\u63a8\u79fb\u5448\u5148\u7f13\u6162\u4e0a\u5347\u3001\u540e\u5feb\u901f\u4e0a\u5347\u7136\u540e\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\uff08\u03c72=2 \n921.03\uff0cP<0.001\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\u57282016\u5e74\u8fbe\u5230\u9ad8\u5cf0\uff08RR=5.29\uff0c95%CI\uff1a4.96~5.65\uff09\uff0c2006\u5e74\u6700\u4f4e\uff08RR=0.24\uff0c95%CI\uff1a0.21~0.28\uff09\uff1b\u51fa\u751f\u961f\u5217\u53d8\u5316\u4e2d\u53d1\u75c5\u7387\u968f\u51fa\u751f\u5e74\u4efd\u63a8\u79fb\u5448\u4e0a\u5347\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\uff08\u03c72=348.88\uff0cP<0.001\uff09\uff0c\u5404\u5e74\u9f84\u7ec4AAPC\u572815.0%~40.0%\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u5448\u4e0a\u5347\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u4e14\u5e74\u9f84\u8d8a\u5927\uff0c\u4e0a\u5347\u5e45\u5ea6\u8d8a\u5927\uff08\u03c72=348.77\uff0cP<0.001\uff09\u3002 \n\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a \n2004-2023\u5e74\u5c71\u4e1c\u7701\u5e03\u75c5\u62a5\u544a\u53d1\u75c5\u7387\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5e74\u9f84-\u65f6\u671f-\u961f\u5217\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u603b\u4f53\u5448\u5148\u4e0a\u5347\u540e\u4e0b\u964d\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u968f\u5e74\u9f84\u589e\u957f\u5448\u5148\u4e0a\u5347\u540e\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u968f\u65f6\u671f\u63a8\u79fb\u5448\u5148\u7f13\u6162\u4e0a\u5347\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u4e0a\u5347\u540e\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u968f\u51fa\u751f\u961f\u5217\u63a8\u79fb\u5448\u4e0a\u5347\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u5e94\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5730\u505a\u597d\u9632\u63a7\u548c\u5065\u5eb7\u6559\u80b2\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5e03\u75c5\u53d1\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\u3002.\n\nDOI: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20250208-00072\nPMID: 40677180 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n19.

The \nage-period-cohort analysis method was used to decompose the age effect, period \neffect and cohort effect of incidence rate and DALY rate of C. trachomatis \ninfection. Results: From 1990 to 2021, the incidence rate of C. trachomatis \ninfection increased from 5 892.02/100 000 in 1990 to 7 402.23/100 000 in 2021 in \nwomen aged 15-49 years in China. The DALY rate increased from 1.92/100 000 \nperson-years in 1990 to 2.00/100 000 person-years in 2021. Joinpoint regression \nshowed that, from 1990 to 2021, the annual incidence of C. trachomatis infection \nin Chinese women age aged 15-49 years increased by 0.74% [average annual percent \nchange (AAPC) =0.74%, 95%CI: 0.67%-0.81%, t=21.94, P<0.001] and the annual \naverage DALY rate increased by 0.11% (AAPC=0.11%, 95%CI: -0.09%-0.30%, t=1.06, \nP=0.287). Age-period-cohort model analyses showed that women aged 30-34 years \nwere at high risk to be infected with C. trachomatis and women aged 40-44 years \nwere at high risk to have high DALY. The period effect showed that the risk for \nC. trachomatis infection began to increase in 1990, peaked during 2000-2004, \nthen gradually decreased. During 2015-2019, the infection risk increased again, \nwhile the risk for high DALY showed a decreasing trend. The cohort effect showed \nthat the risks for C. trachomatis infection and DALY were lower in later birth \ncohorts. Conclusions: From 1990 to 2021, the incidence rate and DALY rate of C. \ntrachomatis infection showed fluctuations in women aged 15-49 years in China. It \nis necessary to pay close attention to the prevention and control of C. \ntrachomatis infection in women aged 30-34 years.\n\nPublisher: \u76ee\u7684\uff1a \n\u5206\u67901990-2021\u5e74\u6211\u56fd15~49\u5c81\u5973\u6027\u751f\u6b96\u9053\u6c99\u773c\u8863\u539f\u4f53\u611f\u67d3\u75be\u75c5\u8d1f\u62c5\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5176\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u4eba\u7fa4\uff0c\u4e3a\u9884\u9632\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u5236\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u79d1\u5b66\u4f9d\u636e\u3002 \n\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a \n\u91c7\u75282021\u5e74\u5168\u7403\u75be\u75c5\u8d1f\u62c5\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5229\u7528Joinpoint\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u67901990-2021\u5e74\u6211\u56fd15~49\u5c81\u5973\u6027\u751f\u6b96\u9053\u6c99\u773c\u8863\u539f\u4f53\u611f\u67d3\u53d1\u75c5\u7387\u3001\u4f24\u6b8b\u8c03\u6574\u5bff\u547d\u5e74\uff08DALY\uff09\u7387\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u5e74\u9f84-\u65f6\u671f-\u961f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5e74\u9f84\u6548\u5e94\u3001\u65f6\u671f\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u51fa\u751f\u961f\u5217\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u6211\u56fd15~49\u5c81\u5973\u6027\u751f\u6b96\u9053\u6c99\u773c\u8863\u539f\u4f53\u611f\u67d3\u53d1\u75c5\u7387\u548cDALY\u7387\u53d8\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002 \n\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a \u6211\u56fd15~49\u5c81\u5973\u6027\u751f\u6b96\u9053\u6c99\u773c\u8863\u539f\u4f53\u611f\u67d3\u53d1\u75c5\u7387\u4ece1990\u5e74\u76845 892.02/10\u4e07\u4e0a\u5347\u81f32021\u5e74\u76847 \n402.23/10\u4e07\uff0cDALY\u7387\u4ece1990\u5e74\u76841.92/10\u4e07\u4e0a\u5347\u81f32021\u5e74\u76842.00/10\u4e07\u3002Joinpoint\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c1990-2021\u5e74\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd15~49\u5c81\u5973\u6027\u751f\u6b96\u9053\u6c99\u773c\u8863\u539f\u4f53\u611f\u67d3\u7684\u53d1\u75c5\u7387\u5e73\u5747\u6bcf\u5e74\u4e0a\u53470.74%\uff3b\u5e73\u5747\u5e74\u53d8\u5316\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\uff08AAPC\uff09=0.74%\uff0c95%CI\uff1a0.67%~0.81%\uff0ct=21.94\uff0cP<0.001\uff3d\uff0cDALY\u7387\u5e73\u5747\u6bcf\u5e74\u4e0a\u53470.11%\uff08AAPC=0.11%\uff0c95%CI\uff1a-0.09%~0.30%\uff0ct=1.06\uff0cP=0.287\uff09\u3002\u5e74\u9f84-\u65f6\u671f-\u961f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c30~34\u5c81\u5973\u6027\u4e3a\u9ad8\u53d1\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\u4eba\u7fa4\uff0c40~44\u5c81\u5973\u6027\u4e3a\u9ad8DALY\u98ce\u9669\u4eba\u7fa4\uff1b\u968f\u7740\u65f6\u671f\u7684\u63a8\u79fb\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u5973\u6027\u751f\u6b96\u9053\u6c99\u773c\u8863\u539f\u4f53\u611f\u67d3\u53d1\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\u6301\u7eed\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u57282000-2004\u5e74\u65f6\u671f\u7ec4\u8fbe\u5230\u5cf0\u503c\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u9010\u6e10\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c2015-2019\u5e74\u65f6\u671f\u7ec4\u518d\u6b21\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u800cDALY\u98ce\u9669\u5448\u4e0b\u964d\u8d8b\u52bf\uff1b\u4e0e\u8f83\u65e9\u51fa\u751f\u7684\u961f\u5217\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8f83\u665a\u51fa\u751f\u7684\u961f\u5217\u5973\u6027\u751f\u6b96\u9053\u6c99\u773c\u8863\u539f\u4f53\u611f\u67d3\u53d1\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\u548cDALY\u98ce\u9669\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002 \n\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a 1990-2021\u5e74\uff0c\u6211\u56fd15~49\u5c81\u5973\u6027\u751f\u6b96\u9053\u6c99\u773c\u8863\u539f\u4f53\u611f\u67d3\u7684\u53d1\u75c5\u7387\u548cDALY\u7387\u5448\u6ce2\u52a8\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce830~34\u5c81\u5973\u6027\u4eba\u7fa4\u53d1\u75c5\u60c5\u51b5\u3002.\n\nDOI: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20250101-00002\nPMID: 40677179 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n20.

A person's phenotype is the result of a complex interaction between \ngenetic and environmental factors; body size, and in particular body mass and \nstature, are strongly influenced by external factors (such as economic \nconditions, famine, physiological stresses, etc.). In this study, we explored \nhow variations in body mass and BMI may reflect changes in the population of \nLondon during the Black Death (1348-1350) and to understand the relationship \nbetween epidemic diseases and changes in body size in the past.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: For this purpose, stature, body mass, and BMI were \nreconstructed using osteologic data from the Wellcome Osteological Research \nDatabase (WORD) of the Museum of London from individuals who died before, \nduring, and after the Black Death in medieval England.\nRESULTS: We observed a significant decrease in weight and stature in the period \nof the Black Death and a slight increase, compared to pre-Black Death data, \nafter the plague epidemic. Values of BMI, conversely, remained more or less \nconstant.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results further clarify the effects of social upheavals before \nthe Black Death on the health of the individuals and reveal new insights into \ntheir health after the extreme devastation. Moreover, we confirmed that BM, as \nwell as stature, can be used to assess health changes in the past.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

The Czech Republic is a region with a natural occurrence of \ngenotype 3 HEV (HEV-3). The disease caused by this genotype has specific \ncharacteristics. The predominant route of transmission is zoonotic, through \nundercooked meat or offal from reservoir animals. Most infections are \nasymptomatic. Symptomatic hepatitis E may present as acute hepatitis with \nnon-specific symptoms of viral infection and elevated serum aminotransferase \nactivity, or it may lead to liver failure and death. Additionally, numerous \nextrahepatic manifestations and the potential for chronic hepatitis development \nin immunocompromised patients have been described. The article provides a \ncomprehensive summary of current recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment \nof hepatitis E virus infections in the context of the Czech Republic.\n\nPMID: 40678883 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n23.

However, the newly discovered PCV3 \nand PCV4 have emerged, and their impact on piglets remains less understood. \nUnderstanding their pathogenicity is crucial for effective porcine health \nmanagement. In this study, 3-week-old piglets were inoculated with PCV2, PCV3, \nand PCV4. PCV2 led to expected growth inhibition and severe clinical signs like \nanorexia. PCV3, though showing milder symptoms, exhibited unique tissue tropism, \nwith detectable virus in the heart, lungs, and brain tissues. PCV4 caused \ndistinct tissue damage, including cardiac fibrosis and renal changes. In terms \nof immune responses, each virus triggered different cytokine profiles. PCV3 and \nPCV4 also demonstrated replication capabilities in vitro and in vivo. PCV3 and \nPCV4 clearly have pathogenic patterns that differ from those of PCV2. These \nfindings provide essential insights for veterinarians and swine producers. \nUnderstanding these viruses' behavior aids in developing targeted prevention and \ncontrol strategies, such as improved diagnostic tools and potential new \nvaccines, to enhance porcine health management and safeguard the swine industry \nfrom the threats posed by these emerging PCVs.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Jiawei Zheng et al.

While TDF is recognized for its \nlipid-lowering properties, the long-term effects of TMF on lipid metabolism \nremain unclear.\nAIM: To assess lipid changes and long-term safety of TMF in CHB, including \noutcomes after TDF-to-TMF switch over 144 weeks.\nMETHODS: This retrospective analysis utilized data from a phase III randomized, \ndouble-blind trial involving 53 patients with CHB treated with either TMF 25 mg \n(n = 39) or TDF 300 mg (n = 14) once daily for 96 weeks. Following this blinded \nphase, all participants entered an open-label extension in which they received \nTMF until week 144. This design enabled assessment of both the comparative \neffects of TMF and TDF and the impact of switching from TDF to TMF, thereby \nreflecting real-world treatment scenarios. Virological, biochemical and imaging \nevaluations were performed throughout the study.\nRESULTS: At week 96, both groups achieved comparable virological suppression and \nmaintained stable hepatic and renal function. However, total cholesterol and \nlow-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly higher in the TMF \ngroup compared to the TDF group (P = 0.012 and P = 0.040, respectively). TDF was \nassociated with a transient increase in serum phosphate (P = 0.030). After \nswitching to TMF, lipid profiles in the former TDF group gradually aligned with \nthose of the continuous TMF group by week 144, with no lipid abnormalities \nobserved in either group.\nCONCLUSION: TMF provides sustained antiviral efficacy and maintains a favourable \nlong-term lipid and renal safety profile. These findings support TMF as a viable \nfirst-line therapy and a switch option for CHB management in clinical practice.\n\n\u00a9The Author(s) 2025. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

ISCs within the crypt niche drive the \ncontinuous self-renewal of intestinal epithelium, preserving its barrier \nfunctions. Paneth cells secrete antimicrobial peptide and signaling molecules \nwithin the intestine crypt, thereby playing a crucial role in intestinal immune \ndefense and providing ISCs functional support. However, the regulatory function \nof Paneth cells under pathological conditions, such as RV infection, remains \nunclear.\nAIM: To determine the impact of RV infection on Paneth cells and how Paneth \ncells regulate ISCs during intestinal injury repair.\nMETHODS: We constructed a reference genome for the RV enteric cytopathogenic \nhuman orphan virus strain and reanalyzed published single-cell RNA sequencing \ndata to investigate Paneth cell responses to RV-induced intestinal injury. We \nderived Paneth-ISC communication networks using CellChat, tracked ISC \ndifferentiation with pseudotime analysis, and validated our findings in \nleucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5-enhanced green \nfluorescent protein-internal ribosomal entry site-Cre recombinase estrogen \nreceptor variant 2 mice and organoids via immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, \nand reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction.\nRESULTS: We found that RV directly infects Paneth cells, leading to a reduction \nin mature Paneth cells and an increase in kallikrein 1-high immature Paneth \ncells. Paneth-ISC communication was significantly enhanced. In particular, the \nbone morphogenic protein 7 (BMP7)-activin A receptor type 2B/BMP receptor type \n1A-Smad pathway was upregulated post-infection, suggesting that Paneth cells \nsuppress excessive ISC proliferation. Functional validation confirmed activation \nof this pathway.\nCONCLUSION: Paneth cells regulate ISC proliferation during RV infection by \nactivating BMP7 signaling, limiting excessive stem cell expansion and preserving \ncrypt homeostasis for effective epithelial repair.\n\n\u00a9The Author(s) 2025.

The approval of nirsevimab, a long-acting \nmonoclonal antibody, has extended the potential for RSV prophylaxis to all \ninfants. This study assesses the cost-benefit of various Nirsevimab prophylaxis \nstrategies for infants during their first RSV season in preventing \nRSV-associated hospitalization in the Tuscany region, Italy.\nMETHODS: The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the healthcare \npayor. Real-world data from the Tuscany birth cohort (N\u202f=\u202f21,017) experiencing \ntheir first RSV season in the 2023/2024 season were used to calculate the net \nbenefit and benefit cost ratio (BCR) of three possible nirsevimab prophylaxis \nstrategies compared with prophylaxis practices at the time of the study, which \nincludes the use of palivizumab in eligible infants. RSV-associated \nhospitalizations and severe hospitalizations were considered as health outcomes. \nSensitivity analyses were performed to identify influential variables.\nRESULTS: Under prophylaxis practices at the time of the study, there were a \ntotal of 663 hospitalizations associated with RSV, including 102 severe cases, \nrepresenting \u20ac5,247,645 in costs. An extended prophylaxis strategy with \nnirsevimab, including all infants born both before and during the RSV season, \nresulted in the highest number of hospitalizations avoided (378), with a BCR \nclose to break-even (0.96). A seasonal-only strategy targeting infants born \nduring the season prevented the fewest hospitalizations (252), showing a \npositive BCR of 1.15. Finally, a seasonal strategy with targeted catch-up, \nincluding also preterm infants born before the season, yielded the highest \ncost-benefit ratio (1.56), preventing 270 hospitalizations.\nCONCLUSION: Universal prophylaxis strategies with nirsevimab, targeting all \ninfants during their first RSV epidemic season, substantially reduce \nhospitalization burdens without increasing economic pressure on the healthcare \nsystem. Although alternative strategies are more cost-effective, they prevent \nfewer hospitalizations, emphasizing the public health value of broader \nprophylaxis approaches.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Lastrucci, Pacifici, Alderotti, Puglia, Berti, Barbati, Lodi, \nBoscia, Nieddu, Indolfi, Peroni, Martini, Azzari, Voller, Moriondo and Ricci.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fpubh.2025.1604331\nPMCID: PMC12267333\nPMID: 40678647 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n27.

However, while polio vaccination campaigns frequently succeed \nin securing humanitarian pauses, WASH initiatives attempting to improve safe \nwater supply and sewage disposal rarely achieve the same outcome. Using the \nIsrael-Gaza conflict as an example, we analyze the factors contributing to the \nsuccess of polio vaccination campaigns compared to WASH initiatives. We identify \nfour key elements that facilitate the implementation of polio campaigns in \nconflict zones: (i) the ubiquitous decline in vaccine coverage and the \nsubsequent detection of polio cases; (ii) international institutional support, \nincluding the role of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI); (iii) the \nshortness of the required humanitarian pauses, the vertical nature, and the \nstraightforward impact assessment of vaccination campaigns; and (iv) their \n\"neutral\" character due to an intentionally restrictive focus on children as the \nprimary beneficiaries. Although polio vaccination campaigns do not typically \nlead to lasting peace and WASH initiatives often fail to secure even temporary \nhumanitarian pauses, public health efforts should seize every opportunity to \nfoster cooperation between warring parties. Such initiatives can help build \ntrust, laying the groundwork for future peace negotiations and post-conflict \nreconstruction.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Sabahelzain, Agha, Davidovitch and Razum.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fpubh.2025.1600755\nPMCID: PMC12269794\nPMID: 40678639 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n29.

The COVID-19 pandemic has \naccelerated the transformation of healthcare services, emphasizing the use of \ndigital resources. Given the rapid brain development in infants in the first \n1,000\u202fdays of life and the demonstrated impact of adaptive neuroplasticity, the \nimplementation of early and ecological interventions are essential for \nsupporting optimal neurodevelopment in this vulnerable population. Aim of this \nproject is to develop a digital tool for parent-led parent-based intervention \nand assess its feasibility and accessibility.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected evidence on early intervention strategies \nfor preterm infants through a non-systematic review of current literature to \ndevelop the platform and created an ad-hoc questionnaire to evaluate the tool's \nfeasibility and acceptability in our neurological follow-up.\nRESULTS: \"NE@R\" is a digital platform designed to support neurodevelopment \nthrough parents-delivered play. The platform offers evidence-based information, \nvideos, and practical activities to enhance motor, cognitive, social, and \nlanguage development at each developmental phase. We introduce the resource in \nour clinical setting and collect 100 preterm infants' families feedback. The \nmajority of parents reported finding the resource beneficial, with many \nexpressing increased confidence in supporting their child's development.\nDISCUSSION: Preterm babies families' support represents a precious field of \nintervention both for parents and infants at risk. \"NE@R\" has proven to be an \neffective, low-cost tool within our follow-up program, aligning with the \nprinciples of family-centered care.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Trussardi, Naboni, Caporali, Pisoni, Ghirardello and Orcesi.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fpubh.2025.1597244\nPMCID: PMC12267281\nPMID: 40678635 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n31.

Here, we report marked age-dependent differences in the \ncytokine response profile of primary porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells \n(PBMCs) to pseudorabies virus (PRV)-infected cells. Notably, IFN-\u03b1 and IL-12 \nproduction in response to PRV remains low to almost undetectable in piglets up \nto 8.5 weeks of age, followed by a marked increase in older piglets, which \ncoincides with age-related shifts in PRV symptomatology. Additionally, we found \nthat PBMC from newborn piglets exhibit a high IL-6 and IL-10 production which, \nin combination with the low IL-12 levels, suggests a suppressed Th1 immune \nresponse, similar to neonatal humans and mice. Our results reveal a remarkable \nage-dependent difference in PBMC cytokine response to PRV and provide a basis to \nidentify cytokines or adjuvants that shift the neonatal immune response towards \na Th1 response, potentially improving outcomes of severe viral infections in the \nneonatal period in both pigs and humans.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Claeys, Brabant, Rosschaert, Van Waesberghe and Favoreel.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1596490\nPMCID: PMC12267268\nPMID: 40677723 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n32.

Herein, we investigated the differential expression \nbiomarkers between RSV infected hospitalized patients, healthy groups and RSV \ninfected outpatients.\nMETHODS: Two publicly available transcriptomic datasets (GSE77087 and GSE188427) \nwere retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The GSE77087 \ndataset comprised peripheral blood samples from 81 children with confirmed RSV \ninfection (61 hospitalized and 20 outpatient) and 23 healthy controls. The \nGSE188427 dataset included 147 RSV-infected children (113 hospitalized and 34 \noutpatient) and 51 healthy controls. Genes with |log2 fold change (logFC)| > 0 \nand false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 were considered differentially expressed. \nOverlapping DEGs between the two datasets were identified using the VennDiagram \npackage. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) \npathway enrichment analyses were conducted on the intersecting DEGs via the \nclusterProfiler package, with terms deemed significant at FDR < 0.05.The \nCIBERSORT algorithm was applied to estimate the relative proportions of 22 \nimmune cell types in 228 RSV-infected samples. Potential drug interactions for \nhug genes were predicted using the Drug-Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb). \nCompeting endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks were constructed using the SpongeScan \ndatabase to identify lncRNAs interacting with the target miRNAs. Networks were \nvisualized using Cytoscape (v3.10.1).Finally, Machine Learning-Based Biomarker \nSelection and hub gene identification and validation.\nRESULTS: Differential gene expression analysis revealed 81 overlapping genes \nbetween hospitalized and outpatient RSV-infected children. Machine learning \nmodels, particularly SVM (area under the curve, AUC = 0.950), prioritized CD79A \nand GADD45A as key predictors of hospitalization. CD79A was significantly \ndownregulated in severe cases, correlating with impaired B-cell responses and \ncytotoxic immunity, while GADD45A, upregulated in severe infections, linked to \noxidative stress and neutrophil-driven inflammation. Immune cell profiling \nhighlighted distinct infiltration patterns, with severe cases showing elevated \nna\u00efve B cells and M0 macrophages versus activated NK cells and M1 macrophages in \nmild cases. Clinical validation in 92 children confirmed CD79A suppression and \nGADD45A elevation in severe RSV (p < 0.001), aligning with younger age, lower \nweight, and respiratory distress. Functional enrichment implicated endoplasmic \nreticulum stress and neutrophil extracellular traps in disease progression. \nDrug-target predictions and ceRNA networks further revealed therapeutic \npotential.\nCONCLUSION: These findings establish CD79A and GADD45A as clinically actionable \nbiomarkers for RSV severity, offering insights into immune dysregulation and \nguiding personalized management strategies.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Chen, Lu, Jing, Nong, Qin, Huang, Lin and Wei.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1609183\nPMCID: PMC12267186\nPMID: 40677720 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.

Vaginal secretions were collected for HPV genotyping and \nmicroecological analysis. Patients were categorized into HR-HPV-positive (n=222) \nand HR-HPV-negative (n=632) groups. The detection rates of various HR-HPV \nsubtypes (HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 53, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, 73, \n82) were analyzed. Key microecological indicators-including vaginal pH, hydrogen \nperoxide, leukocyte esterase, sialidase, Lactobacillus levels, and vaginal \ncleanliness-were compared between the two groups, and their predictive value for \nHR-HPV infection was assessed using ROC curve analysis.\nRESULTS: Significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms \nof vaginal pH, hydrogen peroxide, leukocyte esterase, sialidase activity, \nLactobacillus abundance, and vaginal cleanliness (all P < 0.05). The ROC curve \nanalysis yielded an AUC of 0.701, indicating moderate predictive value.\nCONCLUSION: Changes in the vaginal microecological environment are significantly \nassociated with HR-HPV infection. Monitoring vaginal microecological indicators \nmay provide adjunctive information for clinical prevention and early \nintervention, though further prospective studies are needed to establish \ncausality.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Peng, Xiao, He and Xie.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fcimb.2025.1618846\nPMCID: PMC12267282\nPMID: 40677521 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n34.

DTs, already transformative in other sectors, hold \nsubstantial promise for enhancing operational efficiency, diagnostic accuracy, \nand quality of care in pathology. We provide a comparative analysis of \ntraditional versus DT-enhanced workflows across critical steps including \naccessioning, grossing, processing, embedding, cutting, staining, scanning, \ndiagnosis, and archiving. The framework highlights measurable gains such as up \nto 90% reduction in labeling errors, 20-30% improvements in slide quality, and \n30-50% reductions in diagnostic turnaround time. Alongside these benefits, we \naddress key implementation challenges including upfront infrastructure costs, \nworkforce adaptation, and data security concerns. A practical, phased deployment \nstrategy is proposed-centered on LIS integration, IoT sensors, AI modules, and \nrobust data governance. Estimated setup costs for a medium-sized laboratory \nrange between USD 100,000 and USD 200,000, with a phased rollout timeline of \n12-24 months. Supporting technologies like robotic process automation (RPA), \ncollaborative robotics, and edge computing are also discussed as enablers of \nsuccessful DT adoption. The manifesto closes by identifying critical research \ngaps, including the need for longitudinal studies evaluating DTs' clinical and \neconomic impacts, integration within existing hospital IT systems, and ethical \nimplications of AI-assisted diagnostics. Through this collective vision, we \nprovide a realistic and actionable roadmap to drive the transition toward \npredictive, efficient, and digitally optimized pathology laboratories.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Prior to adoption, it is important to demonstrate \npathologists provide equivalent reports when using digital pathology in \ncomparison to bright-field and immunofluorescent light microscopy, the current \nstandard of care.\nOBJECTIVE: A multicentre comparison of digital pathology with light microscopy \nfor reporting of histopathology slides, measuring variation within and between \npathologists on both modalities.\nDESIGN: A blinded crossover 2000-case study estimating clinical management \nconcordance (identical diagnoses plus differences not affecting patient \nmanagement). Each sample was assessed twice by four pathologists (once using \nlight microscopy, once using digital pathology, the order randomly assigned and \na 6-week gap between viewings). Random-effects logistic regression models, \nincluding crossed random-effects terms for case and pathologist, estimated \npercentage clinical management concordance. Findings were interpreted with \nreference to 98.3% concordance (Azam AS, Miligy IM, Kimani PKU, Maqbool H, \nHewitt K, Rajpoot NM, Snead DRJ. Diagnostic concordance and discordance in \ndigital pathology: a systematic review and meta-analysis. J Clin Pathol \n2021;74:448-55. https://doi.org/10.1136/jclinpath-2020-206764).\nSETTING: Sixteen consultant pathologists, four for each specialty, from six \nNational Health Service laboratories. Experience ranged from 3 to 35 years. Some \nwere early adopters of digital pathology, but the majority were new to digital \npathology.\nINTERVENTIONS: Eight viewings per sample (four pathologists with light \nmicroscopy and with digital pathology), culminating in a consensus ground truth, \nenabling measurement of agreement within and between readers. Samples enrolled \nreflected routine practice, included cancer screening biopsies, and were \nenriched for areas of difficulty [e.g. dysplasia (7, 10, 11)]. State-of-the-art \ndigital pathology equipment designed for diagnosis, and holding either \nConformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9ene or Food and Drug Administration approval, was used.\nMAIN OUTCOME: Intra-pathologist variation between reports issued on digital \npathology and light microscopy, inter-pathologist variation against ground-truth \ndiagnosis using light microscopy and digital pathology.\nSECONDARY OUTCOMES: Pathologist-recorded reporting times, along with their \nconfidence in diagnosis, analysis of eye-tracking evaluating examination \ntechniques, and a qualitative study examining attitudes of pathologists and \nlaboratory staff to digital pathology adoption.\nRESULTS: Two thousand and twenty-four cases (608 breast, 607 gastrointestinal, \n609 skin, 200 renal) were recruited, with breast and gastrointestinal including \nscreening samples [207 (34%) breast, 250 (41%) gastrointestinal]. Overall, in \nlight microscopy versus digital pathology comparisons, clinical management \nconcordance levels were 99.95% (95% confidence interval 99.91 to 99.97). Similar \nresults were observed within specialties [breast: 99.40% (95% confidence \ninterval 99.06 to 99.62); gastrointestinal 99.96% (95% confidence interval 99.89 \nto 99.99); skin 99.99% (95% confidence interval 99.92 to 100.0); renal 99.99% \n(95% confidence interval 99.57 to 100.0)], and within screening cases [98.96% \n(95% confidence interval 98.42 to 99.32), breast 96.27% (94.63 to 97.43), \ngastrointestinal 99.93% (95% confidence interval 99.68 to 99.98)]. Reporting \ntime between digital pathology and light microscopy was similar, but \npathologists became faster on digital pathology with familiarity. Pathologists \nrecorded high levels of confidence in their diagnosis with light microscopy, \nsignificantly higher than digital pathology.\nLIMITATIONS: Cytology cases and specialty groups outside those tested were not \nexamined. The study used two digital pathology scanning systems. Other systems \navailable on the market were not tested.\nCONCLUSIONS: Clinical management concordance levels between the two modalities \nexceed the reference 98.3% in breast, gastrointestinal, skin and renal \nspecialties, and pooled breast and large bowel cancer screening cases. Subgroup \nanalysis of clinically significant differences revealed a range of differences \nincluding areas where interobserver variability is known to be high, which were \ndistributed between reads performed with both platforms and without apparent \ntrends to either.\nFUTURE WORK: The use of digital pathology for cytology samples remains an area \nfor further research.\nSTUDY REGISTRATION: This study is registered as ISRCTN14513591.\nFUNDING: This award was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care \nResearch (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme (NIHR award ref: \n17/84/07) and is published in full in Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 29, No. \n30. See the NIHR Funding and Awards website for further award information.\n\nPlain Language Summary: Pathologists use a microscope to examine tissue samples, \ncalled light microscopy. This enables them to make the diagnosis, give \ninformation on treatment and provide prognosis to clinicians. The reports made \nby pathologists are interpretations of what the slides are showing, and this can \nbe extremely difficult, so differences in interpretation between pathologists \noccur quite often. Asking colleagues\u2019 opinion on cases is one of the best ways \nof recognising and reducing these differences in interpretation. Digital \npathology is a process of converting microscope slides to computer image files. \nDigital pathology allows some advantages to pathologists, namely: to move cases \neasily between pathologists, for example to get a case seen by the next \navailable pathologist who can report it, to view the cases at any location, for \nexample work from home or report cases for a distant laboratory with a shortage \nof pathologists, to confer easily with multiple colleagues on difficult cases, \nand to rapidly check diagnoses made on previous samples the patient may have \nhad. As a result, digital pathology could potentially lead to safer more \nefficient working. In order to use digital pathology in practice, we need to \nknow pathologists produce equivalent reports as compared to light microscopy. \nThis study compared light microscopy with digital pathology in examining 2024 \nsamples from breast, gastrointestinal, including cancer screening samples, skin \nand kidney. Most samples recruited (80%) were routine, but at least 20% of cases \nwere challenging cases. Pathologists worked in teams examining the same series \nof cases twice once through light microscopy and once through digital pathology \nwith viewings separated by 6 weeks and the order randomised. Differences in \nreports were arbitrated to establish if they would have changed treatment \n(significant) or not (insignificant). Pathologists reviewed all the significant \ndifferences to decide the ground truth. Statistical analysis measured the \nagreement between light microscopy and digital pathology in comparison to a \nreference point of 98.3% agreement derived from a previous study. The results \nshow an agreement overall of 99.95%. Specialty groups showing: breast 99.4%, \ngastrointestinal 99.96%, skin 99.99% and renal 99.99%. Cancer screening cases \nshowed overall agreement was 98.96%, and in breast 96.27% and large bowel \n99.93%. In comparison to ground truth, the differences between pathologists were \nsimilar with light microscopy and digital pathology. Analysis showed the \ndifferences detected occurred in entities known to produce differences in \ninterpretation between pathologists. The study shows that pathologists give \nequivalent diagnoses when using digital pathology as they would using light \nmicroscopy. The differences detected are those you would expect to see in any \nevent due to interpretable nature of examining these samples.\n\nDOI: 10.3310/SPLK4325\nPMID: 40654002 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n36.

These AI methods, if marketed and sold, require authorisation or clearance \nas in vitro diagnostic (IVD) devices by regulatory bodies like the Food and Drug \nAdministration (FDA) in the USA or Notified Bodies in the European Union (EU). \nMany AI tools for digital pathology are unlikely to be commercially viable and \ntaken up by commercial entities ready to navigate these complex and costly \nprocesses. However, a longstanding quality framework already exists that allows \nfor lab-developed tests, colloquially known as 'homebrew' tests, that are \nlocally validated and performed under the responsibility and oversight of the \npathologist. Here we argue for advancing homebrew AI systems within this \nexisting framework to enhance patients' access to supportive digital diagnostic \ntools. We outline how homebrew AI models are currently permitted under \nregulatory provisions in the USA and the European Union, how a new US FDA rule \nmay effectively regulate them out of existence, and propose steps to facilitate \nthe safe and effective integration of homebrew AI models in pathology practice. \n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

While knowledge graphs (KGs) offer \npotential solutions, existing medical KG lack multimodal integration and \ncompetency assessment. We designed an integrated Multimodal Knowledge Graph \n(MKG) with O-PIRTAS pedagogy to bridge these gaps.\nMETHODS: Following Design Science Research Methodology, we built a \npathology-specific MKG featuring: (1) Semantic modeling of disease mechanisms \n(etiology-pathogenesis-morphology-clinical), (2) Cross-modal alignment of \ndigital slides/animations/clinical cases, (3) Embedded metrics (KII/MDA/CCAE) \nfor competency quantification. A quasi-experiment with 533 medical students \n(2022 cohort control: n\u2009=\u2009275; 2023 MKG-O-PIRTAS: n\u2009=\u2009258) evaluated outcomes \nvia exam scores, validated questionnaires, and stratified interviews.\nRESULTS: The MKG-O-PIRTAS group achieved significantly higher adjusted exam \nscores (76.14 vs. 73.72, p\u2009=\u20090.033) and 86% lower misdiagnosis rate in high \nperformers (p\u2009=\u20090.015). Cognitive load diverged markedly (57.5 vs. 75.5, \np\u2009=\u20090.007), with high performers dynamically contextualizing MKG nodes into \nclinical reasoning, while novices required scaffolded pathways. Over 80% of \nstudents endorsed enhanced knowledge integration and process optimization.\nCONCLUSION: The MKG-O-PIRTAS artifact transforms scattered pathology knowledge \ninto actionable clinical reasoning scaffolds, proving effective for personalized \ncompetency development. Future work will scale adaptive scaffolding and \nintegrate real-time EMR modules, establishing a replicable paradigm for medical \neducation intelligence.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

However, no \nidentifiable histological abnormalities were found. This study aimed to clarify \nwhether ischemia-induced changes in myocardial cells caused by a sudden decrease \nin coronary blood flow are observed in cases of sudden cardiac death without \ncoronary artery involvement. The autopsy cases included sudden cardiac death \nwithout coronary artery involvement, acute coronary syndrome, or other sudden \ndeaths. We performed double fluorescent immunostaining for connexin 43 (Cx43) \nand its dephosphorylated form (npCx43) and calculated the npCx43 rate. \nAdditionally, immunohistochemical analysis was performed on the complement \nsystem activation in cardiomyocytes using an anti-C5b-9 antibody, and mRNA \nexpression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) was assessed. The results \nshowed a significant increase in npCx43 rate, whereas C5b-9 or HIF-1 mRNA \nexpression did not significantly change. These findings suggest that the npCx43 \nexpression rate may be a useful indicator of rapid ischemic changes induced in \nthe myocardium of patients who die of sudden cardiac death without coronary \nartery involvement.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Elsevier B.V.

Placental pathology has been implicated as a likely cause of injury \nto the developing central nervous system (CNS). This study aims to elucidate the \nassociations of multiple placental pathologies and CNS injury, including more \nsubtle brain pathologies associated with adverse neurologic outcomes. Sixty-five \nsubjects that underwent complete post-mortem neuropathologic examination and \nplacental examination were selected for inclusion. Gross images, autopsy \nreports, and histologic sections from the CNS and placenta underwent blinded \nreviewed by experts in perinatal neuropathology and placental pathology, \nrespectively. Immunostains useful in highlighting CNS lesions not apparent on \nroutine histologic sections were performed. Placental pathology was classified \naccording to the Amsterdam criteria, and all placental and CNS abnormalities \nwere documented. A previously undescribed association between white matter \ninjury and fetal vascular malperfusion was seen, likely due to improved \ndetection of injury on immunohistochemical stains. Amniotic fluid infection was \nassociated with acute neuronal injury in the cortex and cerebellum as well as \nsubarachnoid hemorrhage. Hippocampal injury had the strongest association with \nhigh-grade chronic inflammation, and maternal vascular malperfusion showed \nhigher relative frequencies of acute neuronal injury in the basal ganglia, \nbrainstem, and spinal cord. To our knowledge, this is the first study to \nstandardize placental pathology according to the Amsterdam consensus criteria, \nseparate out injury across multiple CNS regions with independent assessment of \nthese regions, and to utilize immunohistochemistry to improve detection of white \nmatter injury. Different patterns of placental pathology were associated with \ndifferent types of CNS injury, indicating neuronal injury and white matter \ninjury may be influenced by distinct placental pathologies. Elucidating the \nplacental contributions to these acquired CNS pathologies in stillborns is \ncrucial for understanding long-term adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes \nassociated with perinatal brain injury.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Clinical Total-Body CT (TBCT) scans of the \n(non-)calcified HLC lack sensitivity for fracture detection. Micro-computed \ntomography (micro-CT) is an upcoming imaging modality capable of scanning \nsamples at microscale resolution up to 1\u202f\u00b5m. Soft-tissue contrast can be \nestablished with iodine staining, known as diffusible iodine-based \ncontrast-enhanced CT (diceCT). We study the additional value of micro- and \ndiceCT in detecting HLC fractures and hemorrhages in forensic cases, compared to \nstandard forensic imaging techniques and findings at autopsy.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen, during forensic autopsy excised, adult HLCs were \nscanned with micro-CT. Subsequently, the samples were stained with buffered \nLugol's solution (B-Lugol) and scanned with contrast-enhanced micro-CT. The \nscans were examined on fractures and hemorrhages. Total body CT, optimized \nclinical CT of the explant and autopsy reports were compared with the micro- and \ndiceCT scans and the results were confirmed using histological examinations.\nRESULTS: Sixteen potential fractures were identified in the micro-CT scans and \nwith diceCT, nine hyperdensities were detected around potential fractures. Two \npreviously undiscovered vital fractures were found, which were verified by \nhistological examination.\nCONCLUSIONS: This research demonstrated that micro-CT can be a valuable tool to \ndetect fractures of the HLC in forensic neck trauma cases and diceCT enables us \nto image the injured HLC in detail and indicate possible hemorrhages. With \nincreasingly better stain and scan protocols and more experience gained by \nforensic radiologists, micro-CT could become invaluable for the examination of \nHLC trauma.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 The Authors.

The pathologist's workspace is often narrow and limits access to \ngrossing information mid-procedure. An ergonomic, open-front containment console \n- called grossing station - can improve this situation. Besides collecting \nairborne formaldehyde and chemical fumes, its cupboard with adjustable vertical \nprotective screen simplifies the workflow with a customisable open work surface \nthat allows image acquisition and includes voice recognition and waste \ndispensers. However, its containment efficiency and compliance with \ninternational safety standards has not yet been investigated. The aim of our \nstudy was to address this lack of information and propose a standard procedure \nfor testing containment efficacy of next-generation grossing stations. For this \npurpose we ran the potassium iodide test and a formaldehyde leak test with a new \ntracer-gas method on a new DFB900 grossing station model and established that \nits protection factor of 105 complied with the EU standards and the NIOSH safety \nlimits. Future research should include a range of new grossing stations and a \nwide spectrum of harmful compounds that pose occupational health risk to their \noperators.\n\nPublisher: Redovita procjena resursa i pove\u0107anje u\u010dinkovitosti postupaka nu\u017enost \nsu u zdravstvenoj skrbi.

U tu svrhu \nproveli smo test kalijeva jodida (pomo\u0107u KI disk metode) i test ispitivanja \nkoncentracije formaldehida u zraku pomo\u0107u nove metode pra\u0107enja curenja plinova \nna modelu radne patolo\u0161ke stanice/digestora DFB900 te ustanovili da je njezin \nza\u0161titni faktor 105 i da udovoljava EU-ovim standardima i za\u0161titnim \nograni\u010denjima NIOSH-a. Budu\u0107a istra\u017eivanja trebaju obuhvatiti niz novih radnih \nstanica za anatomsku patologiju i \u0161irok spektar \u0161tetnih spojeva koji \npredstavljaju rizik za zdravlje radnika u patolo\u0161kim laboratorijima.\n\n\u00a9 2025 Stefano Dugheri et al., published by Sciendo.\n\nDOI: 10.2478/aiht-2025-76-3971\nPMCID: PMC12193986\nPMID: 40561416 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n45.
