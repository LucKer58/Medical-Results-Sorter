By the late nineteenth \ncentury, obstetrical machines, once purpose-built by individual midwives, were \nmass-produced using durable commercial materials. This article focuses on the \nBudin-Pinard manikin, a widely used obstetrical manikin designed in France by \nrenowned obstetricians Pierre Budin and Adolphe Pinard, to illustrate that \nobjects used in obstetrical teaching in this period sought to provide a \nconsistent structure, and through that a framework of method and of practice, \nwithin which the unexpected could be accommodated, managed, and made to signify.\n\nDOI: 10.1353/bhm.2025.a963732\nPMID: 40620249 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n2.

In identifying and delineating the \"normal\" fetal heart \nrate, EFM played a central role in defining obstetric risk and, in the eyes of \nmany practitioners, quickly became an essential tool of \"modern\" and \"safe\" \nhospitalized birth. Focusing on one specific settler-colonial context, this \narticle explores the relationship between obstetric technologies including the \nEFM and the childbirth \"choices\" available to mothers giving birth in late \ntwentieth-century Canada. As smaller hospitals, health centers, and nursing \nstations, particularly in rural, remote, and northern areas, lacked access to \nwhat were framed as essential technologies, obstetric services were withdrawn \nfrom many communities, a shift that continues to disproportionately affect \nIndigenous mothers who are routinely evacuated out to give birth in provincial \nhospitals.\n\nDOI: 10.1353/bhm.2025.a963729\nPMID: 40620246 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n3.

In a \ncomprehensive experimental program, centering on the internal rotation of \nfetuses during birth, he tried to find out what kind of mechanical and expulsive \nforces were at work in the birthing process. From these experiments emerged a \nwealth of objects such as anatomical models, mechanical dolls, measuring \ndevices, new physical instruments, and also birthing machines. By paying close \nattention to these objects and the sociomaterial practices associated with them, \nthis article identifies, tracks, and characterizes the shift to physiology in \nobstetrics. By adopting a historical-praxiographic method, the article reveals \nthe entanglement between the social and the material and renders visible a new \nand wider set of actors and relationships that, in turn, adds a novel dimension \nto the historiography of obstetrics.\n\nDOI: 10.1353/bhm.2025.a963728\nPMID: 40620245 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n4.

Despite this, \nit wasn't until 1818, following the invention of the stethoscope and \npopularization of the technique of auscultation, that the fetal heartbeat was \nfirst discovered. Listening to the fetal heartbeat enabled practitioners to \nconfirm the existence of pregnancy, gain information on the internal positions \nof the fetus and the placenta, and determine the life or death of the fetus in \nutero. Additionally, signs from the stethoscope provided guidance for \npractitioners when dealing with long or difficult labors. This article examines \nthe work and writings of the early key players in this story, emphasizing the \nimpact of enthusiastic stethoscope advocacy on Irish obstetric practitioners' \nuptake of the instrument and how the changes in practice that stemmed from these \nchanges went on to impact practitioners in Scotland.\n\nDOI: 10.1353/bhm.2025.a963725\nPMID: 40620242 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n5.

H. Chan School of Public Health, Harvard University, Boston, MA, U.S.A.\n\nBACKGROUND: For over a decade, the maternal health discourse has focused on a \nphenomenon that is alternatively termed \"obstetric violence,\" \"disrespect and \nabuse\" (D&A) or the \"mistreatment of women\" in institutional obstetric care. The \nsearch for what drives D&A includes questions around the role of medical \neducation in shaping not just what doctors know, but how they learn to treat \nwomen as well. However, medical education as an additional pathway to D&A is \nunder-studied. We explore how one aspect of medical education- practical medical \ntraining during internships and residencies- operate in labour rooms in public \nteaching hospitals.\nMETHODOLOGY: We conducted 37 semi-structured in-depth interviews with a \ncross-section of obstetric care providers representing all cadres of two large \npublic teaching hospitals in a south Indian city. We coded the interview \ntranscripts thematically, examined themes related to teaching and learning, and \nconsidered their implications for Respectful Maternity Care (RMC).\nRESULTS: We identified four pathways through which practical medical training \nhad implications for RMC: (a) professional hierarchies and social hierarchies; \n(b) institutional and educational prioritization of clinical outcomes over \nrespectful care; (c) limited presence and supervision by senior providers in \nlabour rooms; and (d) teaching responsibilities primarily falling on \ninexperienced and overworked peers. The results suggest that ad-hoc teaching \nadaptations prompted students to rely on informal learning, which fostered an \nobstetric practice which runs counter to the principles of RMC.\nCONCLUSION: Reforms in practical medical training, particularly with regard to \nintrapartum care in resource-constrained public hospital settings, can help in \nthe realization of RMC.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Data were collected using a survey that was \ndistributed, via the British Society of Urogynaecologists (BSUG), Royal College \nof Obstetricians & Gynaecologists (RCOG) and the NHS England email directory, to \nconsultant obstetricians and urogynaecologists involved in the post-partum care \nof patients with OASI. A descriptive, thematic analysis of the data was \nperformed.\nRESULTS: One hundred and twenty-six responses were included in the final \nanalysis (estimated response rate~2.5%). The majority of respondents routinely \nconducted clinical and rectal examinations at the post-partum clinic visit \n(81.7% and 57.6%, respectively) but they were less likely to use an objective \nscreening tool for incontinence (36.5%). Respondents were more likely to refer \npatients for anorectal studies if they were symptomatic (72.6%) rather than \nasymptomatic (34.2%); the diagnostic modality of choice was endoanal ultrasound \n(70%) rather than manometry (0%). Almost 80% of respondents discharged \nasymptomatic patients within 3\u2009months. All respondents referred symptomatic \npatients for physiotherapy; 87% were seen within 6\u2009weeks. Although 70% would \ndiscuss complicated cases at a multidisciplinary team meeting (MDT), there was a \nwide variation in which speciality would follow up the patient.\nCONCLUSION: This study demonstrates variability in clinical practice that does \nnot entirely appear to be evidence driven. A nationally endorsed pathway, \nembedded within Perinatal Pelvic Health Services, could standardize access to \nexpertise and enable benchmarking. A prospective multicentre audit is \nrecommended to compare maternal functional outcomes in units that use these \nstandardized pathways versus those that do not.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

Office \nredesign, hospital privileges, and expanded point of care services allowed \nfamily physicians to sustain comprehensive family care including obstetrics.\nRESEARCH DESIGN: Family physicians leased office space in a chronically \nunderserved urban area, with clinical revenue as the primary funding source. The \noffice was redesigned to focus on providing bilingual services in a low resource \ncommunity. Practicing physicians met weekly to improve policies for the care of \nuninsured and poorly insured patients. Independence from hospital and university \ncontrol was essential for the changes that led to a self-sustaining medical \ngroup. The office was open access 7 days a week. A call group of family \nphysicians with hospital privileges for higher risk obstetric care was formed to \ncover deliveries 24/7 365. This was prospectively designed as a longitudinal \nstudy 2005 to 2022. Data on family care and obstetrics were collected.All \nphysicians followed the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) \nguidelines and were subject to hospital peer review. A subset of consecutive \npatients from the index group, 2019 to 2022, provided detailed data describing \noffice visits, high-risk patients, office ultrasound, nursery services, and \nsubsequent well-child family care. Coding and collections analysis tabulated \nrevenue associated with these deliveries. External audits measured quality and \ncost.\nRESULTS: Data from 13,926 consecutive family medicine deliveries over eighteen \nyears underscore sustainability. A subset of 2,335 deliveries from Medicos 2019 \nto 2022 validated quality outcomes of high-risk obstetrics and repeat cesarean \nsections by family physicians. Expanded point of care services data included the \nfirst prenatal visit through postpartum, nursery, and early childcare.\nCONCLUSION: This model provides a framework for retaining obstetric services in \nlow-resource, marginalized communities. Independence from hospital control \nallowed expansion of service which increased access and quality at lower cost.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2025 by the American Board of Family Medicine.\n\nDOI: 10.3122/jabfm.2024.240161R2\nPMID: 40578920 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Conflict of interest: The authors have no \nfinancial interest and no conflicts of interest regarding the content of this \nmanuscript.\n\n\n8.

A thematic analysis was conducted \nusing a phenomenological approach, supported by NVivo software.\nRESULTS: Four main themes emerged: (1) relational malaise in the \ncaregiver-patient relationship, reinforced by public discourse on OV, further \nhindered shared decision-making and open communication. (2) Challenges between \ncaring values and systemic constraints (eg, lack of time, staffing shortages and \nprotocol-driven care) limited professionals' ability to engage in meaningful \ninformed consent discussions. (3) Safety paradigm in obstetrics: fetal \nwell-being emerged as a central and non-negotiable argument to justify medical \ninterventions during childbirth. (4) Informed consent as a source of tension, \nwhere professionals struggled to balance legal and ethical obligations with \nclinical urgency, often leading to coercive or merely formal consent processes.\nCONCLUSIONS: Informed consent during childbirth remains a critical and \nunresolved ethical challenge. This study highlights systemic, relational and \nemotional barriers that hinder shared decision-making and compromise the core \nethical principles of autonomy, beneficence and justice. Addressing these issues \nrequires structural changes, improved working conditions to support \nindividualised care, better training in ethics and communication and greater \nrecognition of the moral distress experienced by healthcare professionals.\nREGISTRATION NUMBER: Registration number 22-219 from CEEI-IRB INSERM (Research \nInstitutional Review Board INSERM, France) (IRB 00003888, IORG 0003254, FWA \n00005831).\n\n\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

To examine the bioethical issues about the \nsubject related surviving spouses and potential children may face.\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional and descriptive survey was conducted between May 1, \n2023, and August 1, 2023. A total of 200 women visiting the K\u0131r\u015fehir Ahi Evran \nUniversity Gynecology and Obstetrics Clinic participated in face-to-face \ninterviews. The survey comprised 20 questions aimed at evaluating participants' \nviews on posthumous reproduction. Data were analyzed using SPSS 25 software, and \nthe Chi-square test was applied, with statistical significance set at p\u2009<\u20090.05.\nRESULTS: Of the participants, 59.5% opposed a woman having a child using a \npreserved embryo after her husband's death, while 75.5% disapproved of a man \nhaving a child through a surrogate after his wife's death. Additionally, 55% \nsupported a woman's reproductive rights in such cases, whereas 57% objected to a \nman exercising the same right. Concerns about the potential negative impact on \nchildren ranged from 50% to 57.5%. The majority believed that posthumous \nreproduction should only be ethically permissible if the deceased had provided \nexplicit consent beforehand.\nCONCLUSION: Findings indicate that perspectives on posthumous reproduction are \ninfluenced by social, cultural, and ethical considerations. Turkish society \ngenerally maintains a reserved and critical stance on this issue, with stronger \nopposition to male surrogacy. The ethical and legal implications of posthumous \nreproduction highlight the need for legal regulations and public awareness \ninitiatives.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Private Medinova Hospital Aydin, \nTurkey.\n\nThis study aims to assess the surgical practices, learning curve, and outcomes \nof 2 obstetrics and gynecology specialists during the first 18 months of their \ncareers, focusing specifically on minimally invasive gynecological procedures. \nData from 277 procedures performed by 2 recently specialized gynecologists in \nTurkey during the first 18 months of their specialization were retrospectively \nanalyzed. Procedures included total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH), vaginal \nhysterectomy (VH), abdominal hysterectomy (TAH), and other gynecological \nsurgeries. Surgical cases were divided into three 6-month periods, and outcomes \nsuch as surgical indications, operative time, length of hospital stay, and \ncomplications were evaluated. The study included 277 procedures performed during \nthe first 18 months of a newly specialized obstetrics and gynecology \nspecialist's practice. TLH was the most frequently performed procedure, with 140 \ncases, followed by VH with 35 cases and total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) with \n22 cases. The study showed a significant reduction in major complications, with \nonly 4 recorded over the 18 months, including bowel injury and bladder injury. \nMinor complications, such as wound infections and hematuria, were reported in 8 \ncases (2.9%), and these decreased significantly over time (P\u2005=\u2005.01). Operation \ntimes were shortest in the TLH group (99.6 minutes), and the average hospital \nstay was shortest for TLH (1.6 days). Overall, 98.6% of surgeries were completed \nwithout major complications, with a 100% success rate in the last 6 months. This \nstudy highlights the challenges and successes of early surgical practice in \ngynecology. TLH emerged as the preferred method due to its advantages, while VH \nwas emphasized as the preferred approach when feasible. Regular simulation \ntraining, higher case volumes during residency, and mentorship contributed to \nsuccessful outcomes. These findings underscore the importance of structured \ntraining and continuous practice in advancing competency in minimally invasive \ngynecological surgery.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 the Author(s).

The \nobjective of this study was to describe the gynecological care provided by these \ndifferent health professionals at the national level.\nMETHODS: A descriptive and analytical study of indicators of gynecological care \n(cervical and vaginal swabs, contraception procedures, and initial contraception \nand preventive consultations) by gynecologists, primary care physicians, and \nmidwives in private practice in 2022, using data from the French National Health \nData System (SNDS) to establish profiles of health professionals using \nmultivariate analysis (principal component analysis and hierarchical \nclustering).\nRESULTS: Three gynecologist profiles, five primary care physician profiles, and \nfour midwife profiles were identified based on the intensity of their \ngynecological care activity and their specialization in certain types of \nprocedures. Professionals with significant gynecological care activity often \nhave a particular focus on private practice, are more frequently female, and \nbelong to younger age groups. The geographical distribution of professionals \nwith significant gynecological care activity varies according to the profession.\nCONCLUSION: We demonstrate significant heterogeneity in gynecological care, both \nbetween different types of professionals and within the same profession. \nUnderstanding gynecological care provision and its dynamics thus requires us to \ntake into account the variety of actors at both the inter- and \nintra-professional levels.\n\nPublisher: INTRODUCTION: En France le suivi gyn\u00e9cologique est assur\u00e9 par trois \ntypes de professionnels de sant\u00e9 : les gyn\u00e9cologues, les m\u00e9decins g\u00e9n\u00e9ralistes \net les sages-femmes.

It involves a gap in knowledge and feelings \nbetween the doctor and the patient, which intensifies in sensitive situations, \nin particular gynecology. It may be accompanied by loss of control, violation of \nprivacy, embarrassment and discomfort. This emotional gap has deepened in the \npast year following the October 7th terror attack. The current training of \nmedical students and residents is insufficient.\nOBJECTIVES: To formulate a comprehensive learning model for trauma-informed \ntreatment.\nMETHODS: A steering committee mapped out principles for formulating and \nimplementing the training: dealing with patients who have experienced trauma and \nidentifying the characteristics of the phenomenon, the type and scope of \ncommunication skills required, and the tools for its implementation, and \nprocessing the therapist's feelings to provide professional confidence relevant \nto the situation. The patients' expressions were collected as a platform for \nworkshops that included theoretical lectures, patient testimonies and actors' \nsimulations.\nRESULTS: A total of 27 residents (in Shamir Hospital) and 35 senior \ngynecologists from 15 health institutions countrywide were trained. An analysis \nof the insights reflected the perceived benefit of professionalism, the \nimportance of acquiring professional tools and the need for additional knowledge \nwhile enhancing the experience of providing care and service. Participants noted \nthe deepening of the ability to identify the phenomenon and deal with patients \nwho have experienced trauma.\nCONCLUSIONS: It is important to promote trauma-sensitive testing among \ngynecologists at a national level, especially in the fields of urogynecology, \nfertility, pregnancy and obstetrics, alongside other clinical fields (urology, \nsurgery, etc.). We recommend exposing medical students in clinical settings and \ninterns during any internship in order to enhance patient-doctor encounter \ndialogue. This process will improve professional skills and patient experience \nat a national level, and increase the overall quality of medical services \nprovided in Israel.\n\nPMID: 40530629 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n15.

These guidelines cover essential domains \nincluding multidisciplinary collaboration, safeguarding patient safety and \nprivacy, continuous staff training, mitigating algorithmic bias, promoting \ntransparent communication with patients, and fostering a continuous feedback \nloop between clinicians and AI developers. Additional recommendations highlight \nthe importance of staying updated on AI advancements, defining the role of AI \nwithin clinical governance frameworks, ensuring long-term sustainability, \ncollaborating with AI vendors for customized solutions, and evaluating outcomes \nto inform future practice. These strategies are designed to position AI as an \naugmentative tool in clinical decision-making, ensuring it enhances rather than \nreplaces human expertise. By upholding collaborative efforts and ethical \nstandards, AI can profoundly improve care quality in OBGYN, fostering safer and \nmore effective healthcare delivery.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Our \nobjective is to understand perspectives of postpartum patients and their \ndelivering obstetrician-gynecologists on the impact of Dobbs on patient \ndecision-making surrounding permanent contraception. From March 2022 to January \n2023, we interviewed postpartum women with a documented desire for permanent \ncontraception (n = 81) and their delivering obstetrician-gynecologist (n = 67) \nat four hospitals in the United States. Participants included in this analysis \nwere interviewed after the Dobbs decision was released in June 2022 and \ncommented on the impact of Dobbs on the patient's decision to request permanent \ncontraception. We used rapid qualitative analysis to create initial key themes \nand subthemes related to discussions of Dobbs, which were further refined using \nthematic analysis. Twenty-three patients and 15 clinicians commented on the \nimpact of Dobbs on permanent contraception decision-making. Several clinicians \ndescribed an increase in permanent contraception demand, especially by young \npatients. Some patients said the ruling influenced their decision to get \npermanent contraception. Several patients suggested feelings of threat against \nreproductive autonomy and asserted that women should be able to make their own \nreproductive health decisions. Some clinicians reported a renewed dedication of \nthe clinical community to meet reproductive health needs, including permanent \ncontraception fulfillment. Several patients and clinicians indicated that the \nimpact of Dobbs on permanent contraception decision-making was dependent on the \nlevel of abortion protection in their state. Clinicians should be aware that \nabortion restrictions from Dobbs may impact patient decision-making surrounding \npostpartum permanent contraception. In the presence of abortion restrictions, \nclinicians should help ensure patients have accurate information about their \ncontraceptive options to support their reproductive autonomy.\n\nDOI: 10.1089/jwh.2024.0425\nPMID: 40499071 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n17.

Jackson Women's Health Organization \n(Dobbs) Supreme Court decision on training of United States Obstetrics and \nGynecology (OBGYN) residents and fellows needs qualitative exploration. We aimed \nto describe how OBGYN residents and fellows feel their training may be affected. \nMethods: We disseminated a REDCap survey from September 19, 2022, to December 1, \n2022, among OBGYN residents and fellows with open-ended questions querying \ntrainees' opinions around how the Dobbs decision may affect their training and \nthe field of OBGYN. Results: The survey received 469 responses, of which 70% \ncontributed data for qualitative analyses. The qualitative data indicated four \nthemes: uncertainty about the future, concerns about patient care, concerns and \ndiscrepancies in OBGYN training, and suggestions and hopes for the future. \nTrainees, even if currently well trained in their view, are concerned about \nother trainees, patient safety in OBGYN clinical situations, and uncertainty \nabout their own careers and the future of OBGYN. They are concerned that \nrestrictions on family planning and pregnancy management in certain states will \nrestrict care access, limit patient safety, and affect the OBGYN workforce in \nthose locations. Conclusions: This survey of OBGYN trainees indicates \nsignificant uncertainty about equity for training and patient care in clinical \nsituations potentially affected by the Dobbs decision and a wider concern about \nhow this will affect the field of OBGYN and the safety of women in the United \nStates.\n\nDOI: 10.1089/jwh.2024.0095\nPMID: 40499057 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n18.

Surgery for cervical cancer is currently performed at \nonly one hospital in the country, Maputo Central Hospital. Before 2020, there \nwere no gynecologists in Mozambique trained to care for women with cervical \ncancer. In 2017, the International Gynecologic Cancer Society (IGCS) started a \ngynecologic oncology training program in Mozambique, and in 2020, the first \nthree fellows graduated from this program. The main objective of this study was \nto report the outcomes of patients with cervical cancer who were treated \nsurgically by the three newly trained Mozambican gynecologic oncologists.\nMETHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of women diagnosed with \ncervical cancer who underwent surgical treatment by the Mozambican gynecologic \noncologists between November 2020 and October 2022. The outcome of interest was \nsurvival at 2 years.\nRESULTS: Thirty-three patients underwent radical hysterectomy with pelvic \nlymphadenectomy for cervical cancer treatment. The median age at diagnosis was \n43 years. After surgery, 15 patients (45%) were dispositioned to surveillance \nand 18 (55%) were referred for adjuvant treatment with radiotherapy and/or \nchemotherapy. All patients had follow-up data available, with a median follow-up \ntime of 19 months (range, 0.2 to 37.5). Only one patient died, and the overall \nsurvival is 95.7% (95% CI, 87.7% to 100%) at 12.7 months.\nCONCLUSION: The IGCS program has provided training to physicians at Maputo \nCentral Hospital, resulting in surgery for cervical cancer being available to \npatients in Mozambique. This is an important step in the global elimination of \ncervical cancer.\n\nDOI: 10.1200/GO-25-00024\nPMCID: PMC12179889\nPMID: 40499056 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The following represents disclosure information \nprovided by authors of this manuscript.

The growing demand for such procedures \nstems from exposure to media and online content that reinforced the notion that \ncertain genital appearances do not conform to an idealized aesthetic standard. \nThere is, however, a lack of strong evidence and limited published research to \nsupport the claim that cosmetic genital surgery is safe and effective. FIGO \nasserts that it is ethically inappropriate for obstetrician-gynecologists to \nrecommend, perform, or refer patients for these procedures. Women should receive \ncounseling and be informed that these procedures are not medically indicated and \ncome with potential risks. Of special concern is the use of laser-based devices \nfor treating the genitourinary syndromes of menopause or for cosmetic purposes. \nThere is insufficient research data to support the safety and effectiveness of \nthese devices. By addressing ethical concerns and ensuring that accurate \ninformation is provided, healthcare professionals can support women in making \nwell-informed choices about cosmetic genital surgery.\n\n\u00a9 2025 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.\n\nDOI: 10.1002/ijgo.70203\nPMID: 40471219 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n20.

A total of 60 rotating physicians, undergoing \nstandardized training in First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical University \nbetween January 2023 and March 2024, were randomly divided into an experimental \ngroup (n=30) and a control group (n=30). The control group followed traditional \nteaching methods, while the experimental group received teaching based on the \nPOA and PDCA cycle. Comparison of pre- and post-teaching scores revealed that \nthe experimental group had significantly higher scores in theoretical \nexaminations, practical operations, and case analysis (P<0.05). Additionally, \nthe experimental group demonstrated greater enthusiasm for learning and stronger \nautonomous learning abilities (P<0.05). Furthermore, teaching satisfaction was \nnotably higher in the experimental group (P<0.05). These findings suggest that \nintegrating POA with the PDCA cycle can significantly enhance the quality of \nclinical teaching, improve learning outcomes, and increase satisfaction among \ngynaecologic oncology physicians.\n\nPublisher: Cette \u00e9tude a explor\u00e9 l'efficacit\u00e9 de la combinaison de l'approche \norient\u00e9e vers la production (AOP) et du cycle Planifier-Faire V\u00e9rifier-Agir \n(PDCA) dans l'enseignement clinique en oncologie gyn\u00e9cologique.

Although limited, some studies suggest an \nameliorating effect of grief and bereavement training (GBT) for some of these \ndifficult clinical situations. Here, we aim to describe the current landscape of \nGBT and assess whether trainees feel equipped to manage difficult losses.\nMETHODS: This study included a review of the published literature in addition to \nsurveys delivered to Canadian obstetrics and gynecology residents and residency \nprograms.\nRESULTS: Literature review demonstrated a positive association between GBT and \npatient care overall, whereas results of our survey emphasize that caring for \npatients experiencing pregnancy loss and stillbirth impacts health care \nproviders and support increased GBT.\nCONCLUSIONS: Findings broadly support increased need for GBT for trainees, which \nremains an important gap in the Canadian obstetrics and gynecology curriculum.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada/La \nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 des obst\u00e9triciens et gyn\u00e9cologues du Canada.

Its \nonset is closely associated with insulin resistance, insufficient compensatory \nfunction of \u03b2 - cells, and abnormal placental function. Epidemiological studies \nhave indicated that type 2 diabetes is an independent risk factor for breast \ncancer. However, the association between GDM and the risk of breast cancer \nremains controversial.\nOBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to comprehensively \nevaluate the association between GDM and the risk of breast cancer and explore \nits underlying mechanisms.\nMETHODS: This study systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, \nEMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases, covering the period from \nestablishing each database until April 14, 2025. Two researchers extracted \nrelevant data and assessed the quality of included studies using the \nNewcastle-Ottawa Scale. The study evaluated inter-study heterogeneity using the \nI\u00b2 statistic. Based on the magnitude of heterogeneity, fixed-effect or \nrandom-effect models were employed to calculate the pooled hazard ratio (HR) and \nits corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Additionally, subgroup analyses, \nsensitivity analyses, funnel plot analyses, and publication bias assessments \nwere performed. All data analyses were conducted using STATA 17 software.\nRESULTS: The overall analysis revealed no significant association between GDM \nand breast cancer risk (HR=1.03, 95%CI: 0.92-1.15). However, subgroup analysis \nrevealed significant regional heterogeneity: within the regional subgroups, \nNorth American results showed an association between GDM and a reduced breast \ncancer risk (HR=0.89, 95%CI: 0.84-0.95), whereas Asian findings suggested an \nassociation with an increased risk (HR=1.23, 95%CI: 1.15-1.31). No significant \nassociations were observed in subgroups based on study design \n(cohort/case-control) or follow-up duration (short-term/long-term). Sensitivity \nanalysis demonstrated robust results, and there was no publication bias in this \nstudy.\nCONCLUSION: In summary, there is no significant association between GDM and \nbreast cancer risk overall. However, notable regional heterogeneity exists: in \nthe North American subgroup, GDM is associated with a reduced risk of breast \ncancer, while in the Asian subgroup, GDM is significantly associated with an \nincreased risk of breast cancer.\nSYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/, identifier \nCRD420251032589.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Li, Li, Jin, Zhang, Li, Xu, Wang, Hu, Wang and Yu.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fendo.2025.1621932\nPMCID: PMC12267041\nPMID: 40678319 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n23.

This study assessed neonatologists' knowledge, attitudes, \nand practices (KAP) regarding GDM-related complications in offspring.\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study of 1,614 neonatologists in Hubei Province, \nChina, utilized a validated 28-item questionnaire examining knowledge (12 \nitems), attitudes (8 items), and practices (8 items). Responses were scored on a \ntrichotomous scale. Binary logistic regression analyzed predictors of \nsatisfactory performance across domains.\nRESULTS: Among 1,614 neonatologists, 1,437 (89%) demonstrated satisfactory \nknowledge, 1,513 (94%) positive attitudes, and 1,165 (72%) good practices. \nKnowledgeable practitioners were significantly older (45.4 vs 36.2 years; OR \n1.42 [95% CI 1.40-1.44]; p<.001) with greater experience (13.8 vs 10.5 years; \n1.41 [1.35-1.46]; p<.001). Academic hospital affiliation showed higher \ncompetency versus community settings (0.12 [0.08-0.20]; p<.001). Practice \npatterns varied by education, with MD-PhD holders demonstrating higher odds of \ngood practice (1.32 [1.03-1.71]; P=.032) compared with fellowship training (0.69 \n[0.51-0.92]; p=.009). Universal documentation of maternal GDM coexisted with \nsuboptimal rates of periodic evaluations (81%) and specialist referrals (84%). \nKnowledge competency (7.52 [5.90-9.60]; p<.001) and positive attitudes (15.81 \n[9.90-25.26]; p<.001) strongly predicted practice patterns.\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite high knowledge levels and positive attitudes, particularly \namong experienced practitioners in academic settings, implementation gaps exist \nin follow-up protocols and specialist referrals. Practice setting significantly \ninfluences care delivery, suggesting the need for standardized protocols across \nhealthcare tiers.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Yang and Yang.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fendo.2025.1574480\nPMCID: PMC12268886\nPMID: 40678316 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n24.

Although PPD's \nscreening is recommended during this period, there is few evidence about the \nassociated Risk Factors (RF) that determine this disorder in women who \nexclusively underwent an Elective Cesarean Delivery (ECD). Hence, our objective \nwas to determine the RF for PPD's positive screening in the early postoperative \nstage after an ECD.\nMETHODS: An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted in 123 women, \nrooming-in at Guadalajara's Civil Hospital Fray Antonio Alcalde, during the \naverage hospital length of stay after an ECD (2.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.02 days). To screen the \nPPD's symptomatology, we applied the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale \n(EPDS). To identify possible RF, we checked the women's sociodemographic \ncharacteristics, obstetric/pregnancy complications, and neonatal comorbidities \nin their Medical Records. Subsequently, we carried out Odds Ratio (OR) analysis, \nfollowed by logistic regression that determined adjusted OR (aOR) and 95% \nConfidence Intervals (95% CI).\nRESULTS: By applying the EPDS, we identified 32.5% of PPD's positive screening, \nassociated with miscarriages (OR 2.6, 95% CI: 1.06-6.30), and multiparity (OR \n2.6, 95% CI: 1.08-6.43) and age\u2009\u2265\u200930 years (OR 2.3, 95% CI: 1.04-5.20). Other \nassociations were with fewer prenatal visits (OR 2.4, 95% CI: 1.10-5.35), \nunplanned pregnancy (OR 2.7, 95%CI: 1.29-5.98), newborn comorbidities (OR 2.7, \n95% CI: 1.18-6.03), and obstetric complications (OR 3.1, 95% CI: 1.37-7.07). \nNevertheless, the logistic regression determined that the history of \nmiscarriages (aOR 4.8, 95% CI: 1.14-9.01), previous history of depression (aOR \n6.0, 95% CI: 1.24-10.25), obstetric complications (aOR 7.2, 95% CI: 1.40-8.41), \nand newborn comorbidities (aOR 8.1, 95% CI: 1.58-12.52) were RF for PPD.\nCONCLUSIONS: Newborn and obstetric complications, along with previous depression \nand possibly miscarriages, were main causes for the presence of depressive \nsymptoms in women with an ECD. By considering not only the latter, but also that \nthe PPD's prevalence that we found was higher than national report's results, we \nsuggest that surgical and health professionals seek these RF -Specifically \nduring this early postoperative period- in order to prevent any negative \nlong-term effects on the mother's mental well-being.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Only three peer-reviewed studies have \ninvestigated NPP-FET protocols, yet none verified spontaneous ovulation, \ncharacterized hormonal dynamics, or evaluated whether variation in P4 initiation \ntiming influences clinical outcomes. Preserving spontaneous ovulation is \nessential for NPP-FET to replicate the physiologic benefits of NC-FET; \nconfirming its consistency is critical to validating NPP-FET as a viable \nprotocol. To our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively address \nthese gaps, providing novel evidence to support NPP-FET's clinical feasibility.\nMETHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 196 first-time NPP-FET cycles \nwith single euploid blastocyst transfers between January 2023 and October 2024. \nDydrogesterone (40\u00a0mg/day) was initiated upon meeting the following criteria: \nleading follicle\u2009\u2265\u200914\u00a0mm, endometrial thickness\u2009\u2265\u20097\u00a0mm, serum estradiol\u2009>\u2009150 \npg/mL, and P4\u2009<\u20091.5 ng/mL. Ultrasound and hormonal monitoring continued until \nultrasound-documented ovulation (UDO), followed by three days of hormone \nassessments. Ovulation was confirmed by UDO and serum P4\u2009>\u20093.0 ng/mL. Embryo \ntransfer occurred on day 6 of dydrogesterone exposure. Multivariable logistic \nregression evaluated associations between pregnancy outcomes and P4 \ntiming-related variables, including follicular phase duration, estradiol and \nfollicular diameter at P4 initiation, P4 start-to-UDO interval, UDO-to-FET \ninterval, and serum P4 on FET day.\nRESULTS: Spontaneous ovulation was confirmed in all participants. Median \nfollicular diameter one day before UDO was 18.6\u00a0mm. UDO occurred within 1-2 days \nin 96.4% and 92.2% of cases based on two LH surge criteria. Peri-ovulatory \nhormone profiles resembled natural cycles. Clinical pregnancy, ongoing \npregnancy, and clinical loss rates were 66.3%, 58.7%, and 11.5%, respectively. \nEmbryo morphology and biopsy day predicted pregnancy outcomes, while P4 \ntiming-related variables showed no association.\nCONCLUSIONS: Flexible dydrogesterone initiation at follicular diameters\u2009\u2265\u200914\u00a0mm, \nbased on predefined criteria, preserves spontaneous ovulation and natural \nhormonal dynamics. Pregnancy outcomes were consistent across P4 initiation \ntimings, supporting NPP-FET as a clinically viable, physiologically grounded, \nand scheduling-friendly protocol.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

This study aimed to explore the transgenerational effects and \nmechanisms of renal developmental toxicity in offspring induced by PDE. We found \nthat PDE caused fetal renal dysplasia and adult glomerulosclerosis phenotype in \nF1-F3 female offspring. Sequencing and experimental assays revealed that PDE \nreduced DNA methylation levels in the promoter region of the imprinted gene \nlncRNA Meg3 (Meg3), increased the expression of Meg3 and reduced the expression \nof the downstream Notch signaling pathway in kidneys of F1-F3 female fetuses. \nMeanwhile, Meg3 expression was increased in oocytes of PDE F1 and F2 offspring. \nThe results of the in vitro experiments confirmed that dexamethasone activates \nGR and reduces DNMT3a expression in primary metanephric mesenchymal stem cells \n(MMSCs), which causes Meg3 hypomethylation/hyperexpression and the inhibition of \nthe Notch signaling pathway, resulting in fetal renal dysplasia. Knockdown of GR \nexpression, overexpression of DNMT3a, or silencing of Meg3 could reverse the \ndownstream-associated alterations. In summary, PDE induced fetal-derived \nglomerulosclerosis phenotype mediated by the GR/DNMT3a/Meg3/Notch signal pathway \nin fetal rats, which had transgenerational inheritance effects and may be \nassociated with increased Meg3 expression transmitted via oocytes. This study \nconfirmed the transgenerational inheritance of fetal-derived glomerulosclerosis \nphenotype induced by PDE and provided an experimental basis for investigating \nthe underlying mechanisms.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Currently, serum \u03b2-hCG is the main predictor for treatment \noutcomes, yet its accuracy is limited. This study aimed to develop and validate \na predictive model that integrates radiomic features derived from \nsuper-resolution (SR) ultrasound images with clinical biomarkers to improve risk \nstratification.\nMETHODS: A total of 228 patients with EP receiving conservative treatment were \nretrospectively included, with 169 classified as treatment success and 59 as \nfailure. SR images were generated using a deep learning-based generative \nadversarial network (GAN). Radiomic features were extracted from both \nnormal-resolution (NR) and SR ultrasound images. Features with intraclass \ncorrelation coefficient (ICC)\u2009\u2265\u20090.75 were retained after intra- and \ninter-observer evaluation. Feature selection involved statistical testing and \nLeast Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression. Random \nforest algorithms were used to construct NR and SR models. A clinical model \nbased on serum \u03b2-hCG was also developed. The Clin-SR model was constructed by \nfusing SR radiomics with \u03b2-hCG values. Model performance was evaluated using \narea under the curve (AUC), calibration, and decision curve analysis (DCA). An \nindependent temporal validation cohort (n\u2009=\u200940; 20 failures, 20 successes) was \nused to validation of the nomogram derived from the Clin-SR model.\nRESULTS: The SR model significantly outperformed the NR model in the test cohort \n(AUC: 0.791\u2009\u00b1\u20090.015 vs. 0.629\u2009\u00b1\u20090.083). In a representative iteration, the \nClin-SR fusion model achieved an AUC of 0.870\u2009\u00b1\u20090.015, with good calibration and \nnet clinical benefit, suggesting reliable performance in predicting conservative \ntreatment failure. In the independent validation cohort, the nomogram \ndemonstrated good generalizability with an AUC of 0.808 and consistent \ncalibration across risk thresholds. Key contributing radiomic features included \nGray Level Variance and Voxel Volume, reflecting lesion heterogeneity and size.\nCONCLUSIONS: The Clin-SR model, which integrates deep learning-enhanced SR \nultrasound radiomics with serum \u03b2-hCG, offers a robust and non-invasive tool for \npredicting conservative treatment failure in ectopic pregnancy. This multimodal \napproach enhances early risk stratification and supports personalized clinical \ndecision-making, potentially reducing overtreatment and emergency interventions.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

From September to October \n2024, convenience sampling was used to select 282 pregnant women and their \nparents from a Class A tertiary hospital in Henan Province to investigate the \nreliability and validity of the Chinese version of MMSP.\nRESULTS: The Chinese version of MMSP consists of 15 items. The correlation \ncoefficients between the scores of each item and the total score of the scale \nrange from 0.873 to 0.935 (P\u2009<\u20090.05), and the critical ratios of each item range \nfrom 12.363 to 14.758 (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Exploratory factor analysis extracted one \ncommon factor with a cumulative variance contribution rate of 82.007%. The \nscale's item-level content validity index (I-CVI) ranges from 0.83 to 1, and the \nscale's average content validity index (S-CVI/Ave) is 0.93. Using the Chinese \nversion of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale as the criterion, the \ncriterion-related validity of MMSP is 0.972 (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The Cronbach's \u03b1 \ncoefficient of the Chinese version of MMSP is 0.984, and the split-half \nreliability is 0.988.\nCONCLUSION: The Chinese version of MMSP has good reliability and validity, which \ncan be used to effectively evaluate the depression status of postpartum women in \nclinical practice and help medical staff identify and intervene in potential \ndepressive symptoms early.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Reduced Placenta Growth Factor (PlGF) and elevated \nGlycosylated Fibronectin (GlyFn) levels reflect these pathological changes. \nCombining these biomarkers into a ratio may enhance PE prediction in high-risk \npregnancies.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the GlyFn/PlGF ratio measured at 20-28 weeks of gestation \nas a predictor of preeclampsia in high-risk pregnancies across four hospitals in \nWest Java, Indonesia, from April-October 2024.\nMETHODS: This prospective cohort study involved 54 high-risk pregnant women. The \nGlyFn/PlGF ratio was analyzed at 20-28 weeks to assess predictive accuracy for \nPE.\nRESULTS: Significant differences were noted between PE and non-PE groups in \npre-pregnancy weight (65.54\u2009\u00b1\u200912.69 vs. 58.53\u2009\u00b1\u20097.85\u00a0kg), BMI (45.52\u2009\u00b1\u200953.73 vs. \n19.84\u2009\u00b1\u20092.97), and systolic blood pressure (153.50\u2009\u00b1\u200919.42 vs. 100.80\u2009\u00b1\u200915.38 \nmmHg) (P\u2009>\u20090.05). Risk factors such as prior PE (P\u2009=\u20090.01), diabetes mellitus \n(P\u2009=\u20090.03), and gestational hypertension (P\u2009=\u20090.02) were more frequent in the PE \ngroup. A GlyFn cutoff of 34.31 ng/mL showed a 2.5-fold increased PE risk \n(sensitivity: 83.33%, specificity: 66.67%, AUC: 0.8071). A PlGF cutoff of 26.72 \npg/mL was associated with a 6.8-fold increased risk (sensitivity: 72.22%, \nspecificity: 97.22%, AUC: 0.9147). The GlyFn/PlGF ratio cutoff of 1.288 \nindicated a 28-fold higher PE risk (sensitivity: 77.78%, specificity: 97.37%, \nAUC: 0.9244).\nCONCLUSION: The GlyFn/PlGF ratio outperforms individual biomarkers in predicting \npreeclampsia in high-risk pregnancies, offering a valuable tool for early risk \nidentification and timely intervention.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

It \nis often difficult to make a definitive diagnosis based on clinical and \nultrasound features alone.\nMETHODS: A total of 40 families with cystic kidney disease from Southwest China \nto meet their genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis needs. To detect renal \ndisease genes, NGS was performed on probands with cystic kidney disease, and \ncandidate variants were validated using Sanger sequencing.\nRESULTS: Among the 40 families, a definitive genetic diagnosis was established \nin 30 cases (30/40, 75.0%), with seven patients having family members who \nsubsequently underwent prenatal diagnosis based on these molecular findings. We \nidentified a total of 38 variants. According to the criteria of the American \nCollege of Medical Genetics and Genomics, 31 variants were classified as \npathogenic or likely pathogenic and sevent were classified as uncertain \nsignificance. Of the 38 variants, 27 were known and 11 were novel.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study expands the mutation spectrum for cystic kidney disease \ngene. Genetic testing is important for clinicians diagnose and guide treatment \npatients with different types of cystic kidney disease accurately. NGS is a \ndetection technology that can be considered, which is effective in avoiding \nunexpected misdiagnoses due to clinical overlap among cystic kidney disease. \nFinally, these results may be useful for the differential diagnosis and genetic \ncounseling of patients with cystic kidney disease.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

It is not known how maternal metabolism and gut microbes influence \nkidney development in the fetus. Here we show that gestational diabetes alters \nmaternal gut microbiota and reduces the production of key fatty acids that \nnormally support kidney development in offspring. We find that these changes \nimpair a molecular pathway involving the receptor GPR43, which promotes the \ngrowth and migration of kidney cells. In a mouse model, restoring short-chain \nfatty acids or transferring gut bacteria from healthy donors improves kidney \ndevelopment in offspring, while blocking GPR43 reverses this effect. This study \nreveals a previously unknown link between maternal gut metabolism and fetal \nkidney formation and may guide future strategies to prevent congenital kidney \ndisorders in children born to mothers with gestational diabetes.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

To address \nthis, we need a rapid and accurate model to predict pregnancy loss in the first \ntrimester. This study aimed to construct an artificial intelligence model to \nautomatically extract biometric parameters from ultrasound videos of early \nembryos and predict pregnancy loss. This can effectively eliminate the \nmeasurement error of B-ultrasound results, accurately predict EPL, and provide \ndecision support for doctors with relatively little clinical experience. A total \nof 630 ultrasound videos from women with early singleton pregnancies of \ngestational age between 6 and 10 weeks were used for training. A two-stage \nartificial intelligence model was established. First, some biometric parameters \nsuch as gestational sac areas (GSA), yolk sac diameter (YSD), crown rump length \n(CRL) and fetal heart rate (FHR), were extract from ultrasound videos by a deep \nneural network named A3F-net, which is a modified neural network based on U-Net \ndesigned by ourselves. Then an ensemble learning model predicted pregnancy loss \nrisk based on these features. Dice, IOU and Precision were used to evaluate the \nmeasurement results, and sensitivity, AUC etc. were used to evaluate the predict \nresults. The fetal heart rate was compared with those measured by doctors, and \nthe accuracy of results was compared with other AI models. In the biometric \nfeatures measurement stage, the precision of GSA, YSD and CRL of A3F-net were \n98.64%, 96.94% and 92.83%, it was the highest compared to other 2 models. \nBland-Altman analysis did not show systematic deviations between doctors and AI. \nThe mean and standard deviation of the mean relative error between doctors and \nthe AI model was 0.060\u2009\u00b1\u20090.057. In the EPL prediction stage, the ensemble \nlearning models demonstrated excellent performance, with CatBoost being the \nbest-performing model, achieving a precision of 98.0% and an AUC of 0.969 (95% \nCI: 0.962-0.975). In this study, a hybrid AI model to predict EPL was \nestablished. First, a deep neural network automatically measured the biometric \nparameters from ultrasound video to ensure the consistency and accuracy of the \nmeasurements, then a machine learning model predicted EPL risk to support \ndoctors making decisions. The use of our established AI model in EPL prediction \nhas the potential to assist physicians in making more accurate and timely \nclinical decision in clinical application.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Therefore, we investigated HPV58 \ndetection rates and E6/E7 allele frequency trends, and analyzed the positive \nselection, viral load, pathogenicity, and persistent infection capacity \nassociated with specific genotypes/mutations using 239\u2009743 exfoliated cervical \ncell samples. Our results show a gradual increase in HPV58 detection rates over \ntime. Allele replacement occurs slowly, with significant changes manifesting \nafter long-term accumulation. The E6 A388C(K93N)\u2009+\u2009E7 prototype enhanced \nshort-term persistent infection capacity without increasing high-grade lesion \npathogenicity, and its frequency increased. Conversely, E7 C632T (T20I) and \nG760A (G63S) mutations enhanced high-grade lesion pathogenicity, whereas G761A \n(G63D) reduced pathogenicity. HPV58 improves adaptive ability by increasing the \npersistent infection capacity without increasing the risk of high-grade lesions. \nHigh viral load was positively correlated with both pathogenicity and persistent \ninfection capacity, suggesting its potential as a risk factor for predicting \ndisease progression in HPV58 screening. No correlation was observed between \nHPV58 viral load and specific gene mutations/genotypes, indicating that \nalternative mechanisms likely drive allele replacement.

This study investigates the role of glutamine in \nenhancing CAR-T cell function against ovarian cancer.\nMETHODS: Metabolomic profiling of blood samples from ovarian cancer patients \ntreated with MSLN-CAR-T cells was conducted to identify metabolic changes. In \nvitro, glutamine pretreatment was applied to CAR-T cells, and their \nproliferation, CAR expression, tumor lysis, and cytokine production (TNF-\u03b1, \nIFN-\u03b3) were assessed. Mechanistic studies focused on the mTOR-SREBP2 pathway and \nits effect on HMGCS1 expression, membrane stability and immune synapse \nformation. In vivo, the antitumor effects and memory phenotype of \nglutamine-pretreated CAR-T cells were evaluated.\nRESULTS: Elevated glutamine levels were observed in the blood of ovarian cancer \npatients who responded to MSLN-CAR-T cell treatment. Glutamine pretreatment \nenhanced CAR-T cell proliferation, CAR expression, tumor lysis, and cytokine \nproduction. Mechanistically, glutamine activated the mTOR-SREBP2 pathway, \nupregulating HMGCS1 and promoting membrane stability and immune synapse \nformation. In vivo, glutamine-pretreated CAR-T cells exhibited superior tumor \ninfiltration, sustained antitumor activity, and preserved memory subsets.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight glutamine-driven metabolic rewiring via the \nmTOR-SREBP2-HMGCS1 axis as a strategy to augment CAR-T cell efficacy in ovarian \ncancer.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT05372692.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

This meta-analysis evaluates survival outcomes in patients \nwith advanced or metastatic ovarian, colorectal, and gastric cancers treated \nwith CRS and multimodal therapies (e.g., HIPEC, extensive intraoperative \nperitoneal lavage (EIPL), systemic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted \ntherapy) versus CRS alone or with control-based regimens, focusing on the \napplicability of these treatments to these specific cancers.\nMETHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane \nLibrary, and the abstracts of the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) \nand American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) congresses up to April 21, \n2025, for randomized trials published in English. The primary outcomes were \noverall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS); secondary outcomes \nincluded mortality, adverse events, and 3- and 5-year OS rates. Hazard ratios \n(HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using fixed- or \nrandom-effects models, depending on heterogeneity (I\u00b2).\nFINDINGS: From 16,064 records, 13 studies (n\u2009=\u20093,925 patients, control \ngroup\u2009=\u20091,894, experimental group\u2009=\u20092,031) met inclusion criteria. The \nexperimental group significantly improved OS (HR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.77 - 0.95, \nP\u2009=\u20090.003, I\u00b2\u2009=\u200922%, P\u2009=\u20090.26) and PFS (HR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.50 - 0.90, \nP\u2009=\u20090.009, I\u00b2\u2009=\u200983%, P\u2009<\u20090.001) compared to the control group. Subgroup analyses \nhighlighted heterogeneity in PFS benefits, with recent trials (published in or \nafter 2023) showing more potent effects (HR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.44 - 0.64, P < \n0.001). Mortality reduction favored the experimental group (risk ratio (RR): \n0.86, 95% CI: 0.75 - 0.99, P\u2009=\u20090.03, I\u00b2\u2009=\u200926%, P\u2009=\u20090.24), though clinical \nrelevance requires cautious interpretation. The experimental group significantly \nincreased grade 3 or worse adverse events (RR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.16 - 1.48, \nP\u2009<\u20090.001, I\u00b2\u2009=\u200931%, P\u2009=\u20090.04), with significant effects driven by digestive \nsystem (RR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.06 - 1.93) and circulatory system (RR: 1.58, 95% CI: \n1.07 - 2.32) events.\nINTERPRETATION: CRS combined with multimodal therapies, confers significant \nsurvival benefits in advanced ovarian, colorectal, and gastric cancers despite \nelevated complication risks.

However, the superiority of one \napproach over the other remains controversial. While previous studies suggest \nthat the letrozole regimen may improve pregnancy outcomes, prospective studies \nare insufficient. Therefore, we designed a multi-center randomized controlled \ntrial to compare the pregnancy outcomes between these two regimens in PCOS \npatients undergoing FET.\nMETHODS: This multicentre, randomised controlled, open-label trial included 155 \nPCOS patients from six hospitals in China between September 2022 and February \n2024. Patients were randomised into either the letrozole ovulation regimen group \n(n\u2009=\u200981) or the programmed regimen group (n\u2009=\u200974) during FET cycles. Subgroup \nanalysis was used among patients with single blastocyst transfer. The primary \noutcome was clinical pregnancy rate, with secondary outcomes including abortion \nrate, live birth rate, and other pregnancy and neonatal outcomes.\nRESULTS: Analysis of 155 FET women showed no significant difference in clinical \npregnancy rates between the letrozole group (62.96%) and the programmed group \n(60.81%, P\u2009>\u20090.05). Similarly, no differences were observed in abortion rate, \nlive birth rate, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes \nmellitus, preterm birth, or neonatal birth weight. However, more patients in the \nletrozole group received single-drug luteal support (53.16% vs. 16.67%, \nP\u2009<\u20090.05). A subgroup analysis of 108 women involving patients who underwent \nsingle blastocyst transfer revealed no significant differences in clinical \npregnancy rates (66.67% vs. 73.33%, P\u2009>\u20090.05) or live birth rates (58.73% vs. \n55.56%, P\u2009>\u20090.05) between the two groups. A higher proportion of women in the \nletrozole ovulation regimen group received single-drug luteal support compared \nto those in the programmed regimen group (58.73% vs. 22.22%, P\u2009<\u20090.05). No \nstatistically significant differences were observed between the groups in terms \nof fertilization method, abortion rate, or obstetric and neonatal outcomes.\nCONCLUSIONS: The letrozole ovulation regimen demonstrated comparable clinical \npregnancy rates to the programmed regimen in PCOS patients undergoing FET, while \nrequiring only simple luteal support. These findings suggest that the letrozole \nregimen may be a favourable alternative for endometrial preparation in this \npopulation.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR2200062244 ( \nhttps://www.chictr.org.cn ).

EOC spheroids \nresist detachment-induced cell death by upregulating stress responses including \nAMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling and AMPK-dependent macroautophagy \n(autophagy), highlighting these pathways as potential therapeutic targets. \nPreviously, we used a pharmacological approach to putatively identify \nCa2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CAMKK\u03b2, encoded by CAMKK2) as \nthe primary activator of AMPK in EOC spheroids. Herein we have generated CAMKK2 \nknockout EOC cell lines via CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to confirm this function \nof CAMKK\u03b2 and explore the impacts of its loss using in vitro and in vivo models \nof metastatic EOC. CAMKK2 knockout spheroids exhibited decreased AMPK \nactivation, autophagic flux, cell viability, and metastatic potential relative \nto parental spheroids, and intraperitoneal xenograft tumours lacking CAMKK\u03b2 grew \nslower than their CAMKK\u03b2-intact counterparts. Effect magnitudes varied between \ncell line models, suggesting context-dependent roles for CAMKK\u03b2 in EOC and \nrationalizing further studies to characterize the underlying mechanisms. \nAltogether, our findings highlight CAMKK\u03b2 as an important contributor to \nmetabolic reprogramming in EOC spheroids and as a potential therapeutic target \nin the setting of advanced disease.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

A central composite rotatable design was employed \nUsing Design-Expert\u00ae software. The formulation factors were cholesterol, span \n60, and sodium deoxy cholate (SDC) amounts (mg), whereas the dependent responses \nwere Entrapment efficiency (EE%), Vesicles' size (VS), and Zeta potential (ZP). \nThe design expert software was utilized to perform the numerical optimization \nprocess. The optimized bilosomal formulation was assessed using differential \nscanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron \nmicroscope (TEM), in-vitro release study, short-term stability study, and \nin-vitro cell proliferation assay and flow cytometry on MCF-7 breast and OV-2774 \novarian cancer cell lines. The optimized formulation was found to be composed of \n19.999, 111.869 and 15 mgs of cholesterol, span 60, and SDC, respectively with a \ndesirability of 0.753. EE%, VS, and ZP were predicted to be 88.4977%, \n594.592\u2009nm, and -44.2354 mV, respectively. The validation process on the \noptimized formula demonstrated that the variation from the predicted responses \nwas less than 5%. The DSC and XRD studies revealed that AXT was entrapped within \nthe bilosomal vesicles. The optimized AXT bilosomal formulation exhibited \nspherical non-aggregated nanovesicles in TEM images. Furthermore, it improved \nAXT release when compared to AXT suspension. According to stability experiments, \nthe optimum bilosomal formulation was stable for thirty days. The cytotoxicity \nof the optimized bilosomal formulation was enhanced on the MCF-7 breast and \nOV-2774 ovarian cancer cell lines compared to AXT suspension even at lower \nconcentrations. Flow cytometry showed that AXT loaded BSMs made a significant \nincrease in the percentage of apoptotic cells in MCF-7 and OV-2774 cells, \nrespectively. Molecular docking suggests that axitinib and SDC decreased the \nactivation of the caspase-8 receptor on the surface of ovarian and breast \ncancer, which consequently led to an increase in anticancer activity. So, BSMs \nmight be regarded a promising carrier of AXT to target ant treat breast and \novarian cancers.\n\nCopyright: \u00a9 2025 Zaki et al.

The \nfollow-up period ranged from 1.0 to 156.0 months. Kaplan - Meier survival curves \nwere used for the analysis of overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival \n(RFS) rates. The correlation between the studied parameters was analyzed \nincluding relative risk (odds ratio, OR) and correlation coefficient.\nRESULTS: The assessment of OR allowed us to identify the following prognostic \nfactors with a negative impact on the 5-year OS and RFS of patients with US: \ndifferentiation grade G3, necrotic areas in tumor tissue, lymphovascular \ninvasion, high mitotic activity (11 or more mitoses per 10 HPF), nuclear atypia \n4+, negative ER and PR statuses, and high Ki-67 expression.\nCONCLUSIONS: Survival of patients with US depends on tumor grade, necrosis, and \nlymphovascular invasion of tumor tissue; mitotic activity and nuclear atypia; ER \nand PR statuses; and the level of Ki67 expression.\n\nDOI: 10.15407/exp-oncology.2025.01.083\nPMID: 40674160 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n41.

The \"Traditional Chinese Medicine-Active \nIngredients-Targets-Pathways\" network for GZFL Pellets in cervical cancer \ntreatment was generated using Cytoscape v10.0.0, and molecular docking of the \ndrug and potential targets was performed to predict the specific targets of \nactive components in Guizhi Fuling Pellets. The inhibitory effects of \nhederagenin, an active ingredient in GZFL Pellets, was tested in cultured \ncervical cancer cells and in nude mice bearing cervical cancer xenografts.\nRESULTS: GZFL Pellets contain 338 active components targeting 247 action sites. \nA total of 10127 cervical cancer-related targets were obtained, and among them \n195 were identified as potential therapeutic targets of GZFL Pellets for \ncervical cancer treatment, including the key targets of GABRA1, PTK2, JAK2, \nHTR3A, GSR, and IL-17. Molecular docking study showed low binding energies of \nthe active components such as hederagenin, campesterol, and stigmasterol for \nprotein-molecule interaction. GO enrichment analysis suggested that GZFL Pellets \ninhibited cervical cancer primarily by regulating responses to steroid hormones, \noxidative stress, and lipopolysaccharides. Among the active components of GZFL \nPellets, hederagenin was found to inhibit cervical cancer cells in vitro and \nsignificantly reduced STAT3 phosphorylation level in the cancer cells. In nude \nmice bearing cervical cancer xenografts, hederagenin effectively inhibited tumor \ngrowth rate without causing obvious adverse effects.\nCONCLUSIONS: GZFL Pellets inhibit cervical cancer cell growth through its \nmultiple active components that target different pathways. Among these \ncomponents, hederagenin inhibits tumor cell growth possibly by directly binding \nto JAK2 protein to inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation.\n\nPublisher: \u76ee\u7684: \u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u7edc\u836f\u7406\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u6842\u679d\u832f\u82d3\u4e38\u6709\u6548\u6210\u5206\u6cbb\u7597\u5bab\u9888\u764c\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u624b\u6bb5\u5bf9\u5176\u6297\u80bf\u7624\u4f5c\u7528\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5: \n\u5229\u7528TCMSP\u3001Genecards\u3001OMIM\u3001TTD\u3001Swiss Target \nPrediction\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u6842\u679d\u832f\u82d3\u4e38\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u9776\u70b9\u548c\u5bab\u9888\u764c\u53d1\u75c5\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u9776\u70b9\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u9776\u70b9\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u8fdb\u884cGO\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0eKEGG\u901a\u8def\u5bcc\u96c6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Cytoscape \nv10.0.0\u6784\u5efa\u6842\u679d\u832f\u82d3\u4e38\u6cbb\u7597\u5bab\u9888\u764c\u7684\u201c\u4e2d\u836f-\u6709\u6548\u6210\u5206-\u9776\u70b9-\u901a\u8def\u201d\u7f51\u7edc\u3002\u5229\u7528CB-Dock2\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5bf9\u836f\u7269\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u4f5c\u7528\u9776\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5b50\u5bf9\u63a5\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u6842\u679d\u832f\u82d3\u4e38\u6709\u6548\u6210\u5206\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u4f5c\u7528\u9776\u70b9\u3002\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u91c7\u7528CCK-8\u3001Western \nblotting\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4f53\u5916\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6842\u679d\u832f\u82d3\u4e38\u6709\u6548\u6210\u5206\u7684\u6297\u80bf\u7624\u6d3b\u6027\u3002\u52a8\u7269\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u752812\u53ea\u96cc\u6027BALB/c\u88f8\u9f20\u6784\u5efa\u88f8\u9f20\u76ae\u4e0b\u79cd\u690d\u7624\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5206\u4e3a2\u7ec4\uff08DMSO\u7ec4\u53ca\u7528\u836f\u7ec4\uff0c6\u53ea/\u7ec4\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u836f\u7269\u4f53\u5185\u6297\u80bf\u7624\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u884c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5207\u7247\u82cf\u6728\u7cbe-\u4f0a\u7ea2\u4e0e\u514d\u75ab\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5316\u5b66\u67d3\u8272\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bc4\u4f30\u836f\u7269\u4f53\u5185\u4f7f\u7528\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u679c: \n\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6842\u679d\u832f\u82d3\u4e38\u5171\u6709338\u4e2a\u6d3b\u6027\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca247\u4e2a\u4f5c\u7528\u9776\u70b9\u3002\u5bab\u9888\u764c\u53d1\u75c5\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u9776\u70b9\u517110127\u4e2a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d6\u4ea4\u96c6\u83b7\u5f97\u6842\u679d\u832f\u82d3\u4e38\u6709\u6548\u6210\u5206\u6cbb\u7597\u5bab\u9888\u764c\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f5c\u7528\u9776\u70b9195\u4e2a\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8282\u70b9\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u7b5b\u9009\u51fa\u5173\u952e\u9776\u70b9\u4e3aGABRA1\u3001PTK2\u3001JAK2\u3001HTR3A\u3001GSR\u548cIL-17\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0e\u6842\u679d\u832f\u82d3\u4e38\u7684\u5173\u952e\u524d10\u540d\u6d3b\u6027\u6210\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u7eed\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u5bf9\u63a5\u3002\u5206\u5b50\u5bf9\u63a5\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5e38\u6625\u85e4\u7682\u82f7\u5143\uff0c\u83dc\u6cb9\u753e\u9187\uff0c\u8c46\u753e\u9187\u7b49\u6210\u5206\u4e0e\u5173\u952e\u9776\u70b9\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u3002\u57fa\u56e0\u672c\u4f53\u5bcc\u96c6\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6842\u679d\u832f\u82d3\u4e38\u6709\u6548\u6210\u5206\u5728\u6cbb\u7597\u5bab\u9888\u764c\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5bf9\u7c7b\u56fa\u9187\u6fc0\u7d20\uff0c\u6c27\u5316\u5e94\u6fc0\uff0c\u8102\u591a\u7cd6\u7b49\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u5e38\u6625\u85e4\u7682\u82f7\u5143\u5728\u4f53\u5916\u548c\u4f53\u5185\u90fd\u80fd\u591f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6297\u80bf\u7624\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u7ec6\u80de\u751f\u957f\u53d7\u5230\u6291\u5236\uff08P<0.05\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6STAT3\u78f7\u9178\u5316\u6c34\u5e73\u964d\u4f4e\uff08P<0.05\uff09\u3002\u52a8\u7269\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u88f8\u9f20\u76ae\u4e0b\u7624\u4f53\u79ef\u751f\u957f\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u6162\uff08P<0.05\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u5e38\u6625\u85e4\u7682\u82f7\u5143\u7684\u4f53\u5185\u4f7f\u7528\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba: \n\u6842\u679d\u832f\u82d3\u4e38\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u6d3b\u6027\u6210\u5206\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4e2a\u9014\u5f84\u6291\u5236\u5bab\u9888\u764c\u7ec6\u80de\u7684\u751f\u957f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u53d1\u6325\u6297\u80bf\u7624\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u5176\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e38\u6625\u85e4\u7682\u82f7\u5143\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0eJAK2\u86cb\u767d\u7d27\u5bc6\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6291\u5236STAT3\u78f7\u9178\u5316\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u663e\u8457\u53d1\u6325\u5176\u6297\u80bf\u7624\u6d3b\u6027\u3002.\n\nDOI: 10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2025.07.08\nPMCID: PMC12268911\nPMID: 40673304 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no competing interests.\n\n\n43.

Descriptive and frequency \nanalysis were employed. Using the K-means algorithm, cluster analysis was \nperformed to group participants based on response similarities.\nRESULTS: 104 women with endometriosis were included with a median age of 35 \nyears. The majority were classified as grade III (57.69%) and IV (25.96%) for \nendometriosis. There was a significant difference in the division of two \nclusters concerning ASRM, with ASRM IV women more frequently associated with \nCluster B, while Cluster A being predominantly formed by ASRM III women. Cluster \nB showed significantly worse data for dyspareunia and dysuria pain levels and \nfor all variables in the FSFI and EHP-30 instruments, except for infertility, \nwhich did not differ between the groups.\nCONCLUSION: ASRM classification is not directly related to clustering. Women \ndiagnosed with endometriosis, mostly ASRM III and IV, exhibit two distinct \npatterns, with one group having worse pain, sexual function and quality of life \nscores compared to the other group. Infertility is a crucial aspect to study \nconcerning the quality of life of women living with the disease and aspiring for \nmotherhood irregardless of the clustering.\n\nDOI: 10.61622/rbgo/2025rbgo47\nPMCID: PMC12266876\nPMID: 40673032 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Conflicts to interest: none to declare.\n\n\n44.

Therefore, this \nstudy aims to evaluate the role of the LEP rs7799039 and LEPR rs1137100 \npolymorphisms in the painful symptoms of endometriosis in Brazilian women.\nMETHODS: A retrospective study was carried out in two Brazilian public hospitals \nwith 237 cases of endometriosis, divided into two comparison groups according to \nthe painful symptoms associated with the disease (absence or presence of severe \nand disabling symptoms). Genetic analysis was performed by real-time PCR \ntechnique, and association analyses were estimated using odds ratio (OR) and 95% \nconfidence interval (CI), using a non-conditional logistic regression model.\nRESULTS: Endometriosis cases showed a high prevalence of painful symptoms: 82% \ndysmenorrhea, 67% dyspareunia, 53% chronic pelvic pain, and 52% cyclical \nintestinal and 25% urinary complaints. Regarding genetic analyses, cases had \n32.7% of the A allele and 11.4% of the AA genotype for the LEP rs7799039 G>A \nSNP, and 17.5% of the G allele and 2.5% for of GG genotype for the LEPR \nrs1137100 A>G SNP. There is a significant association of the LEPR rs1137100 \npolymorphism with chronic pelvic pain (OR=1.75; CI 95%=1.05-2.89) and \ndyspareunia (OR=1.78; CI 95%=1.01-3.12) in women with endometriosis.\nCONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the LEPR rs1137100 polymorphism is \nassociated with increased endometriosis-related gynecological pain and may be a \npotential target for molecular diagnosis of the disease and development of \nindividualized treatment strategies.\n\nDOI: 10.61622/rbgo/2025rbgo43\nPMCID: PMC12266861\nPMID: 40673025 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Conflicts of interest: none to declare."}
