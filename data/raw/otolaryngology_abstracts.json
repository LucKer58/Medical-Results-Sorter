This study evaluates the reliability and quality \nof responses generated by ChatGPT-4, an LLM-driven chatbot, compared to those \nwritten by physicians, focusing on otorhinolaryngological advice in real-world, \ntext-based workflows. Responses from a public social media forum were \nanonymized, and ChatGPT-4 generated corresponding replies. A panel of seven \nboard-certified otorhinolaryngologists assessed both sets of responses using six \ncriteria: overall quality, empathy, alignment with medical consensus, \ninformation accuracy, inquiry comprehension, and harm potential. Ordinal \nlogistic regression analysis identified factors influencing response quality. \nChatGPT-4 responses were preferred in 70.7% of cases and were significantly \nlonger (median: 162 words) than physician responses (median: 67 words; \nP\u2009<\u2009.0001). The chatbot's responses received higher ratings across all criteria, \nwith key predictors of this higher quality being greater empathy, stronger \nalignment with medical consensus, lower potential for harm, and fewer \ninaccuracies. ChatGPT-4 consistently outperformed physicians in generating \nresponses that adhered to medical consensus, demonstrated accuracy, and conveyed \nempathy. These findings suggest that integrating AI tools into text-based \nhealthcare consultations could help physicians better address complex, nuanced \ninquiries and provide high-quality, comprehensive medical advice.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

In the literature, eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) is the most common \ncause of FBO. We analysed ENT FBO admissions and interventions used in our \nhospital to investigate for EoE. Materials and Methods: This paper details a \nretrospective study of adult FBO admissions to an ENT ward from January 2016 to \nDecember 2019 at a single centre. Results: In total, 120 patients were admitted. \nHalf of the patients required instrumentation to resolve the obstruction-31% \nunderwent rigid oesophagoscopy (RO) and 69% oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD). \nBiopsies were taken during 48% of inpatient OGDs and 5% of ROs. 48% had a \nhistopathological diagnosis of EoE. There was no mention of a specific number of \neosinophils per high-power field in 53% of EoE pathology reports. Potentially, \nsome patients were EoE-negative due to an inadequate number of biopsies \ntaken-71% of patients had an insufficient number of biopsies to exclude EoE. A \ntotal of 56% of all patients with FBO did not undergo inpatient or outpatient \nOGDs with biopsies. Conclusions: Biopsies were not taken in all FBO patients \nundergoing oesophagoscopy, leaving EoE underdiagnosed. Follow-up arrangements \nwere often suboptimal to exclude EoE.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/medicina61061047\nPMCID: PMC12195163\nPMID: 40572735 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: R.M. has served on the advisory board on \nmanagement pathways of food bolus obstruction and eosinophilic oesophagitis \norganised by Dr. Falk Pharma.

Electronic address: mtimbang@chla.usc.edu.\n\nINTRODUCTION: Increasing opioid-related complications prompted the American \nAcademy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) to issue \nspecialty-specific clinical practice guidelines encouraging opioid prescription \nreduction in April of 2021. Opioids are frequently prescribed to pediatric \npatients after tonsillectomy for significant post-surgical pain. This study \naimed to evaluate national changes in opioid prescribing rates in these patients \nafter recommendation changes and also characterize associated demographic and \nprocedure-related factors.\nMETHODS: The TriNetX US Database was queried for all patients under 18 years of \nage who underwent tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy between April 2018 \nand March 2024. Patients were stratified by those with and without \nperi-operative opioid prescriptions. Demographic data was assessed with \ndescriptive statistics and paired t-tests. An interrupted time series analysis \nregression was executed to evaluate the impact of the intervention on \nprescribing rates after April 2021.\nRESULTS: Of the 95,861 pediatric tonsillectomy patients identified, 32,986 \n(34.4\u00a0%) received a peri-operative opioid prescription. Opioids prescription \nrates were lower amongst Black patients (26.2\u00a0%) than White (35.5\u00a0%) or Asian \n(38.3\u00a0%) patients. There was a significant decrease in overall opioid \nprescription rate trends before and after guideline statements. Specifically, \nprescription rates significantly decreased by 1.09\u00a0% per 6-month interval in the \npre-guideline period (p\u00a0=\u00a00.050) and by 6.99\u00a0% immediately post-guideline \n(p\u00a0=\u00a00.008).\nCONCLUSION: Clinical practice guidelines have played a significant role in \ndecreasing overall opioid prescription rates after adenotonsillectomy. In \ninstances where opioid use may still be necessary based on patient-specific \nneeds, our findings advocate for equitable and effective pain management.\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed to assess the health literacy of patients seeking care \nat an adult tertiary care Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (OHNS) clinic and \nits correlation with sociodemographic information.Study DesignProspective \ncross-sectional study.SettingTertiary care OHNS clinic.ParticipantsNew adult \npatients who presented to a tertiary OHNS clinic from July 2022 to March \n2023.InterventionsPatients were asked to complete a sociodemographic \nquestionnaire and the BRIEF Health Literacy Screening Tool. The BRIEF is scored \nout of 20 with scores of 17 and higher showing adequate health literacy.Main \nOutcome MeasuresBivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine \nwhether sociodemographic variables were associated with health \nliteracy.ResultsTwo hundred eighteen patients were recruited (59% females, 32% \nwere above age 65). Although the average score on the BRIEF was 17.0\u2009\u00b1\u20093.6, \nabout 33% of participants were found to have inadequate health literacy. \nNon-native English speakers, racial minorities, immigrants, and those with a \nlower income were more likely to have poor health literacy.ConclusionThis study \nhighlights that a significant number of patients presenting to a tertiary OHNS \nclinic have inadequate health literacy, with certain socioeconomic factors \nserving as predictors. Future research is needed to evaluate targeted \ninterventions aimed at improving and advocating for health literacy among OHNS \npatients.\n\nDOI: 10.1177/19160216251330630\nPMCID: PMC12182617\nPMID: 40542672 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe \nauthor(s) declared the following potential conflicts of interest with respect to \nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: J.M.L. has \nreceived research grants and honoraria from Baxter Corporation.

Intellectual \nproperty is a tool that allows developers to gain competitive advantages in \npromoting their products both on the territory of their country, thereby \npromptly replacing the missing product with domestic technologies, and abroad, \nexpanding sales markets for domestic developments, while providing them with \nprotection from unauthorized use in the foreign market. This article examines \nvarious aspects of the importance of intellectual property in the field of \notorhinolaryngology based on statistical data for the period from 1919 to July \n2024. The main trends of inventive activity in the specialty in the USSR and the \nRussian Federation, as well as abroad, are formulated. The predominance of \nresident applicants in the number of copyright certificates in the territory of \nthe Russian Federation has been revealed. Scientists have been and still are key \ndevelopers in the field of otorhinolaryngology throughout the analyzed period. \nThe United States and the People's Republic of China have become the world \nleaders in the number of patents in otorhinolaryngology. Nevertheless, at the \nmoment, favorable conditions have developed in the Russian Federation for the \ncreation and correct registration of intellectual property in

The 2023-2024 application cycle was the first time virtual \nand in-person interview formats were available in otolaryngology-head and neck \nsurgery (OHNS). Programs offered one or both formats, and in some cases, \napplicants were given the choice between the 2. Objective To assess the \nperceptions of OHNS applicants regarding virtual versus in-person interviews \nduring the 2023-2024 application cycle. Methods A 20-question survey was \ndistributed via email through the Association of American Medical Colleges \n(AAMC) to OHNS applicants after Match Day during the 2023-2024 application \ncycle. The survey consisted of multiple-choice, Likert-scale, and open-ended \nquestions to explore applicant preferences surrounding interview format. Data \nwere analyzed using descriptive statistics and statistical significance tests \n(Pearson's chi-square and Fisher's exact tests) to compare responses across \ndifferent demographic groups. Results The survey achieved a 42% response rate \n(216 of 511). Of 199 respondents, 144 (72%) preferred in-person interviews. \nSubgroup comparisons showed no significant differences between gender. While \napplicants who identify as underrepresented in medicine (URiM) reported a strong \npreference for in-person interviews 24 of 35 (69%), their rate of preferring \nvirtual interviews was higher than that of applicants who did not identify as \nURiM (\u03c72=15.5, df=2, P=.001). Of 199 respondents, 152 (76%) preferred allowing \nindividual programs to choose their interview format. Conclusions Overall, OHNS \napplicants show greater satisfaction with, and preference for, in-person \ninterviews.\n\nDOI: 10.4300/JGME-D-24-00894.1\nPMCID: PMC12168982\nPMID: 40529274 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n8.

All monetary data were adjusted to 2024 U.S. dollars using the \nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index. Percent changes in \nreimbursement were calculated.\nRESULTS: The average nominal value of reimbursement for all procedures increased \nby 11.20% from 2000 to 2024. However, after adjusting for inflation, the average \nchange in Medicare reimbursement was -33.52%. The greatest decrease was in CPT \ncode 69714, which saw a 2024 U.S. dollar -66.43% change. The greatest increase \nwas in CPT code 61798, which saw a 43.43% change. An increase in reimbursement \nfor all CPT codes occurred only in 2024. This increase was associated with the \ncalendar year 2024 PFS final rule, which came into effect on March 9 and \nincreased the PFS conversion factor from $32.7442 to $33.2875. From 2000 to \n2024, the PFS conversion factor decreased from $36.6137 to $33.2875.\nCONCLUSION: From 2000 to 2023, Medicare reimbursements for otologic and \nneurotologic procedures decreased after adjusting for inflation. The only year \nwith an increase in reimbursement was 2024, which saw an increase to the PFS \nconversion factor. These trends highlight the need for greater awareness of, and \nagreement on, neurotology reimbursement models among surgeons, policy makers, \nand facility administrators.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025, Otology & Neurotology, Inc.\n\nDOI: 10.1097/MAO.0000000000004524\nPMID: 40466113 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors disclose no conflicts of interest.\n\n\n10.

Effective surgical management relies on accurate \npre-operative biopsy to inform risk status and guide clinical excision margins. \nThrough retrospective analysis, we aim to describe correlation rates of \npre-operative biopsy and final pathology in head and neck KC \nexcisions.MethodsFrom July 2023 to June 2024, 137 KC excisions performed in a \nregional Australian Otolaryngology Head and Neck surgery outpatient skin unit \nwere analysed. Patient demographics, lesion characteristics, preoperative \nbiopsy, and final histopathology were examined.ResultsExcisions were undertaken \nfor 101 basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), 30 squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), and \nsix intra-epidermal carcinomas. Nineteen excisions were performed without \npre-operative biopsy and 15 further excisions were re-excisions for close or \ninvolved margins and were not included in correlation analysis. Of the remaining \n97 KC, there was concordance between biopsy and formal pathology risk status in \n47.4%. Upgraded (higher) risk formal pathology was reported in 19.6% while \ndowngraded (lower) risk formal pathology was reported in 8.2%. Within the higher \nrisk group, three BCC excisions reported close margins when their lower risk \nsubtype (if confirmed) would have been considered clear. There was no residual \nmalignancy in 24.7% of KC excisions. Pathologic concordance rates after subgroup \nanalysis were 58.7% for BCCs and 9.1% for SCCs.ConclusionAccurate pre-operative \nbiopsy to guide treatment options and inform clinical margins is especially \nimportant for head and neck KCs, where functional and cosmetic constraints are \ngreatest. The correlation rate for surgically excised head and neck KCs has not \nbeen previously investigated in the Australian regional setting. This work \nhighlights the importance of counselling patients on the potential for higher \nrisk final pathology when discussing the risk of requiring further treatment.\n\nDOI: 10.1177/00368504251344182\nPMCID: PMC12089709\nPMID: 40388704 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Declaration of conflicting interestsThe authors \ndeclared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, \nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\n\n13.

Children and \nadolescents (CAAs) are particularly vulnerable to OM. However, epidemiological \ndata on OM in CAAs is relatively scarce. This study investigates the global, \nregional, and national burden of OM in CAAs from 1990 to 2021, with projections \nextending to 2040.\nMETHODS: Data were extracted from Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) 2021 on \nincidence, prevalence, deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Trends \nwere evaluated using the metric of estimated annual percentage change (EAPC). \nSubgroup analyses were conducted according to socio-demographic index (SDI), and \nage. Additionally, projections were estimated for 2040 using the Nordpred model.\nRESULTS: Globally, the rates with their 95% uncertainty intervals (UI) in 2021 \nwere 12473.66 (7287.91-19931.88) for incidence, 2438.73 (1918.03-3055.21) for \nprevalence, 0.0095 (0.0022-0.0320) for deaths, and 49.33 (27.68-78.84) for \nDALYs. From 1990 to 2021, the EAPC and its 95% UI of incidence rate increased by \n0.13 (0.11-0.16), while EAPC of deaths -3.79 (-4.07 to -3.52), prevalence -0.08 \n(-0.09 to -0.07), and DALYs -0.2 (-0.23 to -0.17) decreased. The aforementioned \nindicators are negatively correlated with the SDI. Regionally, both mortality \nrates and DALYs significantly decrease with increasing SDI. Sub-Saharan Africa \nand South Asia have high levels of incidence and prevalence. At the national \nlevel, countries with a high burden of OM are primarily concentrated in \nSub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. For example: Pakistan, India, Ethiopia, \nKenya, Nepal, Bangladesh, Somalia, South Sudan, Mozambique, Burundi, and \nMadagascar. From 2022 to 2040, the incidence rate, prevalence, and DALYs of OM \nare expected to show a downward trend. However, the mortality rate may slightly \nincrease.\nCONCLUSION: From 1990 to 2021, there has been some progress in the management of \nOM. However, the incidence in CAAs has increased. Epidemiological data vary \nacross different regions and countries, with regions and countries with lower \nSDI typically experiencing a heavier burden. It is necessary to implement \ndynamic monitoring of OM in CAAs and develop strategies to mitigate the future \nburden of this disease.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Chen, Deng, Sun, Sun, Lu, Jiao, Zhu, Lu and Sima.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fpubh.2025.1552405\nPMCID: PMC12267207\nPMID: 40678646 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n14.

In this study, a consanguineous Chinese family with USH, including \ntwo affected individuals and five unaffected individuals, was recruited. All \nsubjects received an ophthalmic examination and an auditory examination. The two \nUSH patients exhibited severe early-onset hearing and vision loss. DNA samples \nfrom the two USH patients were analyzed using whole-exome sequencing. A novel \nhomozygous frameshift mutation (NM_206933.4:c.6379_6380delinsC, p.G2127Pfs\u221725) \nin USH2A, resulting in a truncated USH2A protein lacking 3051 amino acids, was \nidentified in the proband. In addition, novel compound mutations in USH2A (one \nallele harboring NM_206933.4:c.9958G>T, p.G3320C; NM_206933.4:c.8284C>G, \np.P2762A; and the other NM_206933.4:c.6379_6380delinsC; p.G2127Pfs\u221725) were \nidentified in the other affected individual. In silico analysis predicts that \nwhile the p.G3320C mutation has little impact on the local structure around the \nmutation site, the p.P2762A substitution may alter the protein's interaction \nwith its binding partners. In addition, p.G2127Pfs\u221725 causes a truncation of a \nmajor portion of the protein that severely disrupts the protein structure and \nresults in the loss of its function. In conclusion, this study identified novel \nUSH mutations in USH2A and expanded the spectrum of disease-associated variants \nin the USH2A gene, which will promote the molecular screening of genetic \nmutations in USH patients.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Haolin Wang et al.

Ltd., Suzhou Industrial Park, Suzhou, \nJiangsu, China.\n(4)Changchun Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural \nSciences, Changchun, Jilin, China.\n\nPurpose: The study was aimed at identifying the pathogenic gene responsible for \nX-linked nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL) in a five-generation Chinese family \nand at elucidating the gene's function both in vivo using a zebrafish model and \nin vitro using PRPS1 knockdown HEI-OC1 cells. Methods: Exome sequencing (ES) and \nSanger sequencing were used to identify the pathogenic variants. A transgenic \nzebrafish model overexpressing the novel PRPS1 variant (c.494G>A: p.Cys165Tyr) \nwas constructed, and PRPS1 was knocked down in HEI-OC1 cells using siRNA to \nexplore the underlying mechanisms. Hair cell development and behavior were \nassessed in zebrafish, and mitochondrial function and cell viability were \nanalyzed in HEI-OC1 cells. Results: A novel missense variant (c.494G>A: \np.Cys165Tyr) in the PRPS1 gene was identified as the pathogenic variant causing \nprogressive X-linked deafness-1 (DFNX1). The variant led to hair cell death in \nzebrafish, with disrupted swimming behavior. In HEI-OC1 cells, PRPS1 knockdown \nresulted in downregulation of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide \n(NAD+)/sirtuin 3 (SIRT3)/superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) pathway, increased \nreactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and \napoptosis, which were partially rescued by pretreatment with nicotinamide \nmononucleotide (NMN), a precursor of NAD+. Conclusion: The study reports a novel \nPRPS1 variant contributing to the variant spectrum of PRPS1 and highlights the \nrole of PRPS1 deficiency in increasing oxidative stress-induced hair cell \napoptosis via the NAD+/SIRT3/SOD2 pathway. These findings provide new insights \ninto the molecular mechanisms of PRPS1-related hearing loss and potential \ntherapeutic targets.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Yining Wan et al.

A retrospective analysis of real words \nwas undertaken, obtained from a-CYLEX, a parent-reporting tool of receptive and \nexpressive vocabulary which was completed for 17 children with CI, aged from 21 \nto 71\u00a0months (Oktapoti et al. in Deaf Educ Int 18(1):3-12, 2016). The data for \neach word was re-coded into sonorous-loaded, nonsonorous-loaded and neutral \nwords, and also into five word categories based on number of syllables. Metrical \nvalues were obtained following normalization of data. Results indicated similar \ntrends in sonority and prosodic word categories based on normalized scores, in \nchildren with CI and NH peers, for both receptive and expressive vocabulary. \nYet, differences in vocabulary size among the three groups were noted.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Although \nventilation tube (VT) insertion during palatoplasty is common, its universal use \nis debated due to uncertain long-term benefits and potential complications. This \nstudy aimed to identify preoperative audiological predictors of VT necessity and \nevaluate VT-related complications.\nMETHODS: A retrospective review was conducted on 65 non-syndromic CP patients \nwho underwent palatal repair without prior or concurrent VT placement. \nPreoperative audiological evaluations were performed, and patients were followed \npostoperatively for VT insertion and complications. Preoperative hearing \nthresholds, cleft severity (Veau classification), and VT related complications \nwere analyzed statistically.\nRESULTS: The likelihood of VT insertion rose significantly in parallel with the \nseverity of preoperative hearing loss, ranging from just 5.9% in patients with \nnormal hearing to 75% in those with moderate conductive hearing loss (CHL) (p < \n0.001). Pairwise comparisons showed significant differences between normal \nhearing and both mild (p = 0.0026) and moderate CHL (p = 0.01). CP severity was \nnot associated with preoperative hearing but correlated with higher VT placement \n(Veau I: 10%, Veau IV: 69.2%; p = 0.035). Complications included otorrhea \n(45.2%), early extrusion (35.5%), and tympanic membrane perforation (12.9%), \nwith no significant associations to preoperative hearing level and CP severity.\nCONCLUSION: Preoperative hearing level at the time of palate repair is a strong \npredictor of VT need in CP patients. Mild to moderate CHL significantly \nincreases the risk of persistent OME, supporting early intervention. Normal or \nslight loss often resolves without treatment, favoring a conservative approach. \nHigher cleft severity is associated with increased VT placement rates; it does \nnot correlate with preoperative hearing levels or increased VT-related \ncomplications. These findings highlight the value of individualized, \nhearing-based decisions over routine tube placement.\n\nDOI: 10.24953/turkjpediatr.2025.5804\nPMID: 40674761 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that there is no conflict of \ninterest.\n\n\n18.

Otomicroscopic examinations were performed on days 7 and \n14 to evaluate tympanic membrane healing and myringosclerosis development. Two \nrats from each experimental group were randomly selected for killing on day 7, \nwith the remaining specimens collected on day 14. Histopathological analysis \nassessed acute and chronic inflammation, lamina propria edema and congestion, \nsclerosis, fibroblastic reaction, and squamous epithelial layer thickness.\nRESULTS: The PRF-treated group demonstrated superior healing outcomes compared \nto the myringotomy-only group. By day 14, complete tympanic membrane closure was \nachieved in all eight ears of the PRF group versus six of eight ears in the \nmyringotomy group. Electrophysiological measurements revealed significantly \nimproved signal-to-noise ratios in the PRF group, approaching normal levels by \nday 14 (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Histological examination showed reduced inflammation and \nbetter-organized tissue architecture in PRF-treated specimens.\nCONCLUSION: PRF application significantly enhanced tympanic membrane healing, \naccelerated closure time, and improved histological outcomes in traumatic \nperforations. These findings suggest PRF represents a promising therapeutic \noption for traumatic tympanic membrane perforation repair, warranting further \nclinical investigation.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

As emotion recognition is an \nessential ability that affects social interaction, and in extension, can impact \nwell-being, understanding vocal emotion recognition difficulties is a high \npriority research topic. Furthermore, it has been shown that although hearing \naids improves word recognition, it does not improve emotion recognition. To \nexplore emotion recognition and the effect of amplification in individuals with \nhearing loss, we examined recognition of vocal emotions expressed both verbally \nand non-verbally in middle-aged to older individuals with and without linear \namplification (similar amplification across sound levels). Twenty-one \nexperienced hearing aid users with bilateral mild-to-moderate hearing loss, and \n20 individuals with normal hearing performed a vocal emotion recognition task on \nsentences and non-verbal vocalizations. The hearing loss group had poorer \nemotion recognition for both sentences (F(1,38)=15.24, p <0.001, \u03b72p=0.29, \nwithout linear amplification, and F(1, 38)= 5.62, p=0.023, \u03b72p=0.13, with linear \namplification) and non-verbal vocalizations(F(1,38)= 25.18, p <0.001, \u03b72p=0.40, \nwithout linear amplification, and F(1, 38)= 10.30, p=0.003, \u03b72p=0.21, with \nlinear amplification). However, linear amplification significantly improved the \nrecognition of happiness (p < 0.001), which is distinguished by frequency \nparameters, for sentences. For non-verbal vocalizations, recognition of fear (p \n= 0.004) and anger (p = 0.004), were improved by linear amplification. Patterns \nof confusion were similar for the two groups, which may suggest that both groups \nperceived the emotions similarly, but that the degree of perceptual precision \nwas lower in the hearing loss group. In sum, hearing loss negatively impacts \nvocal emotion recognition, but linear amplification can enhance recognition for \nsome emotions.\n\nCopyright: \u00a9 2025 Ekberg et al.

Nonetheless, our \nunderstanding of the neural mechanisms underlying sensory and cognitive \nprocessing in CHH remains incomplete. The 40-Hz cortical auditory steady-state \nresponse (ASSR) has been widely used as a marker of auditory system integrity \nand shown to relate to cognition. Thus, the current study sought to determine \nthe impact of mild-to-severe hearing loss on cortical ASSR dynamics. \nThirty-seven participants ages 7-15\u00a0years old heard a broadband click train \nstimulus presented at 40\u00a0Hz binaurally during magnetoencephalography (MEG). Peak \nsources in the bilateral primary auditory cortices were identified, and the \npower envelope of the 40\u00a0Hz ASSR was extracted as a function of time and \nsubmitted to linear mixed modeling. We found a significant three-way \ninteraction, suggesting that CHH exhibit altered ASSR dynamics between \nhemispheres compared to CNH. Moreover, hearing aid use was significantly \ncorrelated with left hemisphere ASSR power in CHH. These data underscore the \nimportance of consistent auditory access in CHH and provide preliminary evidence \nthat neuroimaging may hold promise in determining the mechanisms underlying \nbehavioral variability in this population.\n\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2025.

However, the diagnosis and treatment of diseases lack uniform \nprinciples.\nPATIENT CONCERNS: A 64-year-old woman who was admitted to our hospital with \nprogressive difficulty walking.\nDIAGNOSES: Based on the patient's history of traumatic lumbar fractures, \nprogressive hearing loss, and physical examination findings indicative of \ncerebellar ataxia, sensorineural deafness, and bilateral pyramidal tract \ninvolvement, combined with susceptibility-weighted imaging revealing linear \nlow-signal intensities on the surfaces of the cerebral hemispheres, sulci, and \nspinal cord, a diagnosis of SSCNS was made.\nINTERVENTIONS: The patient received treatment with Ginkgo biloba leaf extract \ntablets, mecobalamin, and vitamin B1.\nOUTCOMES: Her symptoms remained stable.\nLESSONS: A literature review has revealed that most patients with SSCNS exhibit \ndiverse clinical manifestations. Clinicians should consider SSCNS in patients \npresenting with hearing impairment and gait ataxia, particularly those receiving \nanticoagulant therapy, brain injury, or surgical intervention. The clinical \nmanifestations, imaging findings, management strategies, and prognosis of these \ncases are discussed, highlighting the key roles of magnetic resonance imaging \nand susceptibility-weighted imaging in establishing a definitive diagnosis. In \naddition, the importance of a multidisciplinary team approach in providing \nholistic care for individuals has been emphasized. Clinicians are advised to \ninvestigate SSCNS in patients with hearing impairment and gait ataxia, \nparticularly in those with a history of brain injury or surgery, using magnetic \nresonance imaging results.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 the Author(s).

The TriAGe\u2009+\u2009score was developed \nto predict AIS in patients presenting with VDS without relying on neuroimaging; \nhowever, its diagnostic accuracy compared with ABCD-based scores remains \nuncertain. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of the TriAGe\u2009+\u2009score in \ndistinguishing central ischemic causes from peripheral etiologies in patients \nwith VDS and to compare its predictive accuracy for AIS, including posterior \ncirculation infarctions (PCIs), with that of the ABCD2, ABCD3, and ABCD3-I \nscores.\nMETHODS: This retrospective cohort study evaluated 1,138 patients who presented \nto a tertiary ED with VDS complaints between January 2023 and July 2024. After \napplying the exclusion criteria, 886 patients were included. All patients \nunderwent diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging within 72\u00a0h for \ndiagnostic confirmation. On the basis of the imaging results, 210 patients were \ndiagnosed with AIS, while 676 patients without findings consistent with AIS were \nconsidered the control group. The predictive performance of the TriAGe\u2009+\u2009and \nABCD scores was evaluated in both groups via logistic regression and receiver \noperating characteristic (ROC) analyses.\nRESULTS: PCIs accounted for 74.3% of all AIS cases. The TriAGe\u2009+\u2009score \ndemonstrated greater diagnostic accuracy than did the ABCD scores in the ROC \nanalysis among all patients (AUC\u2009=\u20090.979; 95% confidence interval [CI]: \n0.967-0.987). For the diagnosis of AIS in all patients, the TriAGe\u2009+\u2009score had a \ncutoff value of >\u20097, with a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 91.3%. In \npatients without focal weakness or sensory loss, the TriAGe\u2009+\u2009score remained a \nstrong predictor of AIS, with a cutoff value of 5, yielding a sensitivity of \n97.5% and a specificity of 80.9% (AUC\u2009=\u20090.950; 95% CI: 0.932-0.964).\nCONCLUSION: The TriAGe\u2009+\u2009score is useful in the diagnosis of AIS in patients \npresenting to the ED with VDS complaints. It outperforms ABCD scores in \nsensitivity and specificity, particularly in cases without focal neurological \ndeficits. Implementing the TriAGE\u2009+\u2009score may optimize neuroimaging use, reduce \nhealthcare costs, and improve ED efficiency by assisting clinicians in \nprioritizing high-risk patients.\nCLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Challenges include differentiating \nnon-life-threatening conditions, like vestibular migraine, from severe issues, \nsuch as stroke. The \"TiTrATE - STANDING Adapted\" algorithm was created to help \nnon-specialist emergency physicians diagnose posterior circulation strokes in AV \npatients, overcoming the limitations of current practices that require \nspecialized knowledge and equipment. This study involved a prospective \nvalidation and retrospective analysis of 67 patients at the National Hospital \nfor Neurology and Neurosurgery and University College London Hospital. Patients \nunderwent objective oculomotor assessments through video oculography and pure \ntone audiometry, conducted by an experienced audiologist in the acute stage. The \naccuracy of the \"TiTrATE - STANDING Adapted\" algorithm was compared to final \ndiagnoses made by specialists, which included a comprehensive review of medical \nhistories, objective test results, and imaging studies. The \"TiTrATE - STANDING \nAdapted\" algorithm demonstrated a sensitivity of 90%, with low specificity \n(57.9%), resulting in a high rate of false positives (24 out of 67) and a global \naccuracy of 62.7%. Conditions such as vestibular migraine and chronic vascular \nissues (e.g., orthostatic hypotension) were often misclassified, impacting the \noverall specificity. Integrating TiTrATE, HINTS Plus, and STANDING into a single \ndiagnostic algorithm for acute vertigo in the ED could enhance accuracy and \nstreamline decision-making. However, the combined model must perform at least as \nwell as its individual components. Key improvements needed before implementation \ninclude adding vestibular migraine criteria, refining stroke exclusion \nguidelines, and ongoing validation to boost diagnostic precision and patient \noutcomes.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Mucosal swelling \nfrom a cold or allergic rhinitis (AR) can obstruct pressure equalization, \nleading to mucosal tears, cranial pain, and nasal bleeding. Despite its \nsignificance in aerospace medicine, high-quality imaging, nasal endoscopy, \nlong-term outcomes, and the impact of AR management on sinus barotrauma remain \ninadequately documented in the literature.\nCASE REPORT: A 29-yr-old healthy male healthcare provider experienced severe \nfrontal sinus barotrauma during aircraft descent, presenting with intense \nfrontal headache, ocular pain, and left epistaxis, with head computed tomography \nrevealing a fully opacified left frontal sinus. Despite experiencing persistent \nsevere AR symptoms daily, he had never been diagnosed or treated for AR, and his \nsymptoms worsened during the flight. The clinical presentations and image \nfindings suggested a diagnosis of frontal sinus barotrauma. His initial \ntreatment included oral decongestants, antihistamines, and acetaminophen. \nRemarkably, follow-up computed tomography/magnetic resonance images over 2 wk, 1 \nmo, and 1 yr demonstrated the spontaneous resorption of the submucosal \nhemorrhage in the frontal sinus. Furthermore, though concurrently diagnosed with \nperennial AR due to house dust mite and cat fur sensitization, the patient's \neffective pharmacological management of AR symptoms led to an uneventful flight \n1 yr later.\nDISCUSSION: This case demonstrates that submucosal hemorrhages in the affected \nsinus generally resolve spontaneously within a year. Also, it highlights the \ncritical need for diagnosing and managing sinonasal disorders in symptomatic \nindividuals before flights to prevent sinus barotrauma. Park MJ, Kang SJ, Kim \nGT, Kim S.

Specific data to guide rare \ndisease management during a pandemic such as COVID-19 are lacking.\nMETHODS: To better define the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HHT, we \nconducted a retrospective and prospective observational descriptive review of \nHHT patients in central South Africa. Epistaxis severity scores (ESSs) and \nhaemoglobin (Hb) levels before and after the start of the pandemic were \ncompared. Variables that may have influenced epistaxis severity and anaemia were \ninvestigated, viz. (i) mask use, (ii) nasal versus oral swabs to test for \nSARS-CoV-2, (iii) COVID-19 disease and (iv) its management, (v) COVID-19 \nvaccines, and (vi) the social impact of the pandemic.\nRESULTS: Twenty-four patients with confirmed HHT were included in the study. \nSubset analyses revealed a clinically significant change in ESSs (\u2265\u20090.71 minimal \nimportant difference) and Hb levels (>\u20092.7% biologic variation) in 6/11 (54.6%) \nand 12/15 (80%) patients. While the median ESS improved in 2/11 (18.2%) \npatients, it worsened in 4/11 (36.4%) patients during the pandemic. However, the \nchanges in the median ESS (2.25 pre-pandemic versus 2.5 during the pandemic; \np\u2009=\u20090.38) and Hb level (9.5\u00a0g/dL pre-pandemic versus 10\u00a0g/dL during the \npandemic; p\u2009=\u20090.38) for the study population were not statistically significant. \nClinical and social variables that may influence epistaxis severity and anaemia \nwere identified. Nasal swab testing for SARS-CoV-2 induced epistaxis in 9/12 \n(75%) cases and was noted as an important factor.\nCONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a clinically significant impact on \nepistaxis severity and anaemia in some individuals with HHT in central South \nAfrica. Specific strategies are needed to optimise the management of HHT during \nthe COVID-19 and future respiratory pandemics.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

In the modeling group, AR model was \nprepared using systemic and local attack sensitization method with ovalbumin. \nThe successfully-modeled rats were randomized into a model group (6 rats), a \nmedication group (6 rats) and a moxibustion group (14 rats). In the moxibustion \ngroup, the suspending moxibustion was operated at bilateral \"Feishu\" (BL13), 40 \nmin each time, once daily, for 21 consecutive days; during which, the \ntemperature of the body and tail was recorded. During intervention, if the \ntemperature of the body and tail increased by >1 \u2103, the heat-sensitive reaction \nat the point was determined in the rats of the moxibustion group, and these rats \nwere collected in a heat-sensitive moxibustion group (8 rats involved and 6 rats \nof them were randomly collected to ensure the sample-size consistency); and \nthose without heat-sensitive moxibustion reaction were assigned to a traditional \nmoxibustion group (6 rats). In the medication group, fluticasone propionate \nnasal spray was applied, 8 \u03bcL on each side, once daily and for 21 days. The \nbehavioral score for AR symptoms after modeling and intervention, and the \ncontent of serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) after modeling were observed. After \nintervention, the histological morphology of the nasal mucosa was observed using \nHE staining, the positive expression of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in \nthe nasal mucosa was detected using immunohistochemistry, the levels of IgE, \ninterleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-13 and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) were detected by ELISA, \nand the protein expression of the member 4 of tumor necrosis factor receptor \nsuperfamily (OX40), phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-AKT), phosphorylated \nphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p-PI3K) in nasal mucosa was detected by Western \nblotting.\nRESULTS: After modeling, the behavioral score of AR symptoms and serum IgE level \nin the modeling group were higher than those of the blank group (P<0.01), \nsuggesting the success of AR modeling. After intervention, compared with the \nblank group, the behavioral score of AR symptoms was increased (P<0.01)\uff1bthe \nnasal mucosa structure was disordered, the inflammatory infiltration was severe; \nthe positive expression of TSLP in the nasal mucosa increased (P<0.01), the \nlevels of serum IgE, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 elevated (P<0.01), and the level of \nIFN-\u03b3 decreased (P<0.01); and the protein expression of OX40, p-AKT, and p-PI3K \nin the nasal mucosa increased (P<0.05) in the model group. Compared with the \nmodel group, the behavioral score of AR symptoms was reduced (P<0.01); the nasal \nmucosa structure, inflammatory infiltration, and vascular dilation were \nameliorated to varying degrees; the positive expression of TSLP in the nasal \nmucosa decreased (P<0.01); the content of serum IgE, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 \ndecreased (P<0.05), and that of IFN-\u03b3 increased (P<0.05) in the medication, \ntraditional moxibustion, and heat-sensitive moxibustion groups. Compared with \nthe model group, the protein expression of p-AKT was reduced in the medication \nand traditional moxibustion groups (P<0.05), the protein expression of OX40, \np-AKT, and p-PI3K in the nasal mucosa decreased in the heat-sensitive \nmoxibustion group (P<0.05). When compared with the medication group, the \npositive expression of TSLP in the nasal mucosa was reduced (P<0.05) in the \nheat-sensitive moxibustion group. In comparison with the traditional moxibustion \ngroup, the content of serum IL-13 was reduced and the content of IFN-\u03b3 elevated \nin the heat-sensitive moxibustion and the medication groups (P<0.05), the \nprotein expression of p-PI3K reduced in the medication group (P<0.05), and the \npositive expression of TSLP and the protein expression of OX40 and p-PI3K in the \nnasal mucosa were reduced in the heat-sensitive moxibustion group (P<0.05).\nCONCLUSION: Heat-sensitive moxibustion at \"Feishu\" (BL13) can alleviate the \nsymptoms of AR rats, ameliorate the inflammatory infiltration and telangiectasia \nof nasal mucosa, and inhibit immunoinflammatory response, which may be obtained \nby regulating PI3K/AKT signal pathway.\n\nPublisher:

The current framework of pharmaceutical care for managing AR focuses \non community pharmacies, with limited structured pharmaceutical care in public \nhealth care settings.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a pharmacist-led education \nintervention (AR-PRISE) in a public health care institution compared with \nstandard care for managing AR among adults.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial used a 2-arm, \nparallel-group, open-label design in the otorhinolaryngology clinic of a \ngovernment-funded tertiary referral hospital in northern Malaysia. Enrollment \noccurred from June 1, 2023, to February 15, 2024, with follow-up completed \nAugust 6, 2024. The trial included Malaysian patients aged 18 to 80 years who \nhad received a diagnosis of AR and were able to comprehend English or Malay. Of \nthe 209 screened patients, 154 were recruited and randomly assigned into \nintervention and control groups, with 149 completing the study.\nINTERVENTIONS: The AR-PRISE intervention involved an 8-minute educational video \non AR and structured pharmacist counseling.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were between-group differences \nat day 180 in knowledge level, symptom control (Total Nasal Symptom Score [TNSS] \nfor the past 12 hours and past 2 weeks), medication adherence (number of days of \nintranasal corticosteroid use), and quality of life (assessed by the European \nQuality of Life 5-Dimension 5-Level Instrument and European Quality of Life \nVisual Analog Scale). Assessments were conducted at baseline and days 60 (\u00b17), \n120 (\u00b17), and 180 (\u00b17). All analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat \nbasis.\nRESULTS: Among the 154 participants, the mean (SD) age was 46.5 (17.0) years, \nand 97 (63.0%) were women; 77 participants were randomized to each group. In the \nintention-to-treat analysis, the intervention group showed statistically \nsignificant improvement in TNSSs for the past 2 weeks compared with controls \n(estimate [SE], 0.14 [0.06]; 95% credible interval [CrI], 0.03-0.25). \nSignificant reductions in the TNSS for the past 2 weeks were observed at all \ntime points (day 60: estimate [SE], 0.18 [0.05]; 95% CrI, 0.08-0.28; day 120: \nestimate [SE], 0.21 [0.05]; 95% CrI, 0.11-0.31; and day 180: estimate [SE], 0.11 \n[0.05]; 95% CrI, 0.01-0.21). No significant differences were observed for \nknowledge level, TNSS for the past 12 hours, medication adherence, or quality of \nlife.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, the AR-PRISE \nintervention significantly improved AR symptom control (TNSS for the past 2 \nweeks) compared with standard care over 180 days but did not show significant \neffects on other coprimary outcomes (AR knowledge, TNSS for the past 12 hours, \nmedication adherence, or quality of life). These findings suggest that while \npharmacist-led education can enhance symptom management, additional strategies \nmay be needed to address broader aspects of AR care.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT06027736.\n\nDOI: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.17160\nPMCID: PMC12268493\nPMID: 40668584 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Conflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.\n\n\n29.

Antibody 212597 specific for this allergen \nwas recently isolated by single cell sequencing of bone marrow B cells of a \ngrass pollen-allergic subject. This antibody, although subjected only to a low \nlevel of hypermutation resulting in six amino acid substitution across the heavy \nand light chain variable domains, has achieved sub-nM affinity for the allergen, \nsuggesting that antibodies specific for this major group of allergens can be of \nhigh affinity even at the na\u00efve, unmutated stage. The present study was designed \nto assess affinity and biophysical characters of the antibody, its inferred \nunmutated ancestor, and other intermediate and allelic variants thereof.\nMETHODS: Site-directed mutagenesis was used to revert substitutions of antibody \n212579. Mutants, including its inferred unmutated common ancestor were \ncharacterized with respect to allergen affinity, thermostability, and \nhydrodynamic radius.\nRESULTS: We demonstrate that even the antibody's inferred unmutated common \nancestor shows high affinity for the allergen in the low-nM range. Glutamate at \nheavy chain position 38, a residue unique to allele IGHV3-48*03, the germline \ngene origin of the heavy chain of antibody 212579, was critical for high \naffinity binding. Substitution to serine as found in other alleles of IGHV3-48 \nreduced the affinity about 20-fold. A substitution, N40HT in the heavy/light \nchain variable domain interface, introduced into the antibody through somatic \nhypermutation, did not impact its affinity for the allergen but reduced its \nthermal stability and increased its hydrodynamic radius.\nCONCLUSION: Unmutated, high affinity (low-nM) antibodies specific for a major \nallergen (Phl p 5) can be generated directly in na\u00efve B cells and are, given an \nappropriate rearrangement, imprinted into the repertoire through rearrangements \ninvolving immunoglobulin germline gene alleles IGHV3-48*03 and IGKV3-20*01. This \nspecificity depends on an allele-unique residue encoded by the immunoglobulin \ngermline repertoire. Substitutions in the heavy/light chain variable domain \ninterface, such as N40HT in a heavy chain variable domain, might negatively \nimpact biophysical properties of the antibody and should be considered as \ntargets for further evolution or reversion if they negatively impact an \nantibody's developability properties.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Ess\u00e9n, Franciskovic, Sele, Godzwon and Ohlin.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1600778\nPMCID: PMC12259648\nPMID: 40666503 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n30.

Despite the extent of its influence on several chronic medical \nconditions related to the heart, lungs, and others, the relationship between \none's access to digital resources and oncologic conditions has been seldom \ninvestigated in select pathologies among gastrointestinal and head-neck regions. \nHowever, studies on the influence of this \"digital inequity\" on other cancers \npertaining to nasal and paranasal sinus cancer (NPSC) have yet to be performed. \nThis remains in stark contrast to the extent of large data approaches assessing \nthe impact of traditional social determinants/drivers of health (SDoH), such as \nfactors related to one's socioeconomic status, minoritized race or ethnicity, \nand housing-transportation status, on prognostic and treatment outcomes.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to use the Digital Inequity Index (DII), a novel, \ncomprehensive tool that quantifies digital resource access on an area- or \ncommunity-based level, to assess the relationship between inequities in digital \naccessibility with NPSC disparities in prognosis and care in the United States.\nMETHODS: Patients with NPSC from 2008 to 2017 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, \nand End Results Program were assessed for significant regression trends in the \nlong-term follow-up period and treatment receipt across NPSCs with increasing \noverall digital inequity, as measured by DII. DII was based on 17 census-tract \nlevel variables derived from the summarized values overlapping that same time \nperiod from the US Census/American Community Survey and Federal Communications \nCommission Annual Broadband Report. Variables were categorized as \ninfrastructure-access (ie, electronic device ownership, internet provider \navailability, and income-broadband subscription ratio) or sociodemographic \n(education, income, age, and disability), ranked, and then averaged into a \ncomposite score to encompass direct and indirect factors related to digital \ninequity.\nRESULTS: Across 8012 adult patients with NPSC, males (n=5416, 67.6%) and White \nrace (n=4293, 53.6%) were the most represented demographics. With increasing \ndigital inequity, as measured by increasing total DII scores, significant \ndecreases in the length of long-term follow-up were observed with nasopharyngeal \n(P<.01) and maxillary sinus cancers (P=.02), with decreases as high as 19% (35.2 \nto 28.5 months, nasopharynx). Electronic device and service availability \ninequities showcased higher-magnitude contributions to observed associated \nregression trends, while the income-broadband ratio contributed less. \nSignificantly decreased odds of receiving indicated surgery (lowest odds ratio \n0.87, 95% CI 0.80-0.95, maxillary) and radiation (lowest odds ratio 0.78, 95% CI \n0.63-0.95, ethmoid) for several NPSCs were also observed.\nCONCLUSIONS: Digital inequities are associated with detrimental NPSC care and \nsurveillance trends in the United States, even when accounting for traditional \nSDoH factors. These results prompt the need to include digital factors into the \ndiscussion of contextualizing SDoH-based analyses of cancer care disparities, as \nwell as the specific factors from which prospective implementations and \ninitiatives can invest limited public health resources to alleviate the most \npertinent drivers of disparities.\n\n\u00a9 David J Fei-Zhang, Amelia Sherron Lawrence, Daniel C Chelius, Anthony M Sheyn, \nJeffrey C Rastatter.

This study aims to evaluate DAR for EoE-tx using the FDA Adverse Event \nReporting System. FDA Adverse Event Reporting System was queried for DAR between \n2022Q1 and 2023Q4. Individual DARs (iDARs) were categorized and compared between \ntreatment groups: EoE, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and chronic rhinosinusitis \nwith nasal polyps. Logistic regression was used to predict serious DAR and \noutcomes, and zero-truncated negative binomial regression was used to predict \nthe number of iDAR. There were 51,000 DAR observations; 1459 for EoE-tx with 103 \n(7.1%) serious reactions and 44 (3.0%) serious outcomes including 3 deaths. For \nEoE-tx, the mean iDAR was 3.68 [3.51, 3.85], and the iDAR incidence rate ratio \namong men receiving EoE-tx was 0.73 [0.65, 0.83]. EoE-tx average iDAR primarily \nincluded general (0.75 [0.70, 0.80]), injection-site (0.69 [0.63, 0.74]), \ndermatologic (0.51 [0.46, 0.55]), and gastrointestinal (0.24 [0.21, 0.27]) \nreactions. Adults \u226550\u00a0years had 1.97 [1.28, 2.99] higher odds for serious DAR \ncompared to younger adults in EoE-tx. Overall, dupilumab demonstrated a \nfavorable safety profile across all indications, with low rates of serious \nadverse events. For EoE-tx specifically, higher total iDAR rates were observed, \ndriven largely by increased injection-site and gastrointestinal reactions \ncompared to other indications. Additionally, women exhibited higher iDAR rates \nthan men across all indications.\n\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2025.

This study investigates the role of long non-coding RNA \nNEAT1 in promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in CRSwNP, focusing \non its regulatory interaction with the miR-199-3p/PAK4 axis.\nMETHODS: NEAT1 expression was assessed in nasal epithelial cells from CRSwNP \npatients using qPCR and FISH. Primary human nasal epithelial cells and BEAS-2B \ncells were subjected to NEAT1 knockdown via siRNA. Cell migration, barrier \nfunction, and cytoskeletal dynamics were evaluated through scratch assays, \nTranswell migration, FITC-Dextran permeability testing, and phalloidin staining. \nEMT marker expression was analyzed via Western blotting and immunofluorescence. \nTranscriptome sequencing identified PAK4 as a downstream effector. In vivo \nvalidation was performed using a mouse nasal polyp model, and molecular \ninteractions among NEAT1, miR-199-3p, and PAK4 were confirmed via \ndual-luciferase reporter assays. Rescue experiments further elucidated \nmechanistic pathways.\nRESULTS: In comparison to controls, NEAT1 expression was significantly elevated \nin the epithelial tissues of CRSwNP. NEAT1 knockdown inhibited cell migration, \nenhanced epithelial barrier integrity, and reversed EMT-associated cytoskeletal \nremodeling. E-cadherin levels increased, while N-cadherin and vimentin \ndecreased. Transcriptomic and functional analyses identified PAK4 as a \nNEAT1-regulated target. NEAT1 was shown to sponge miR-199-3p, thereby relieving \nits inhibitory effect on PAK4. Overexpression of miR-199-3p suppressed PAK4 and \nmitigated EMT-related changes induced by NEAT1.\nCONCLUSION: NEAT1 promotes EMT in nasal polyp epithelial cells by modulating the \nmiR-199-3p/PAK4 axis, highlighting its potential as a diagnostic biomarker and \ntherapeutic target in CRSwNP.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Li, Jiang, Zhang, Zheng, Yuan, Shen, Zhao, Lu and Yang.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1613179\nPMCID: PMC12256258\nPMID: 40661947 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n33.

Despite its significant impact on quality of life and \nproductivity, evidence-based interventions for occupational CRS remain limited.\nOBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the effectiveness of combined health education \nand nasal irrigation in reducing CRS symptoms among direct labor workers at the \nHai Phong Cement Plant, Vietnam.\nMETHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted from 2014 to 2015, \ninvolving 90 workers diagnosed with CRS. Participants were randomly assigned to \nan intervention group (n=45), receiving nasal irrigation kits and training, or a \ncontrol group (n=45), receiving health education only. Health education sessions \nfocused on improving knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) related to CRS \nprevention. Nasal irrigation involved twice-daily rinsing with 0.9% saline \nsolution. Outcomes were assessed using structured questionnaires, clinical \nexaminations, and the Intervention Effectiveness Index (HQCT).\nRESULTS: The health education intervention significantly improved KAP scores, \nwith a 2967% increase in positive attitudes and an 847% improvement in \nunderstanding preventive measures. Nasal irrigation demonstrated substantial \nefficacy, reducing moderate nasal discharge by 58% and nasal congestion by \n1600%. Objective findings revealed a 1657% increase in workers reporting no \nnasal cavity discharge and a 158% improvement in nasal mucosal health. After six \nmonths, 60% of the nasal irrigation group reported \"good\" improvement, compared \nto 11.1% in the control group (p < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the synergistic potential of health education \nand nasal irrigation in managing occupational CRS. Nasal irrigation, in \nparticular, emerged as a highly effective, low-cost intervention for alleviating \nCRS symptoms in high-risk industrial settings. These findings underscore the \nimportance of integrating non-pharmacological approaches into occupational \nhealth programs to safeguard respiratory health among workers exposed to \nenvironmental hazards.\n\n\u00a9 2025 Nguyen Quang Hung, Vo Hoang Long,Nguyen Quang Truong.\n\nDOI: 10.5455/medarh.2025.79.184-189\nPMCID: PMC12253579\nPMID: 40657344 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: There are no conflicts of interest.\n\n\n34.

This study aimed \nto investigate the effects of daily mean temperature, relative humidity (RH) and \nprecipitation on outpatient visits for CRS.\nMETHODS: Electronic records of CRS outpatient visits were collected from Tongji \nhospital in Wuhan, China from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019. Daily \nmeteorological data were obtained from the Wuhan Meteorological Bureau during \nthe same period. A generalized additive negative binomial regression model \ncombined with a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) was employed to analyze \nthe lag-exposure-response relationship between meteorological factors and the \nnumber of CRS outpatient visits. Stratified analyses were conducted to identify \npotential effect modifications by age and season.\nRESULTS: A total of 14,259 CRS outpatient visits were recorded. Relative \nhumidity and precipitation showed no significant association with daily CRS \nvisits, whereas low temperatures significantly elevated CRS outpatient visits. \nSpecifically, extreme temperature (-1.8\u00b0C, 1st percentile) was found to be \nassociated with 1.946 (95% CI 1.273-2.973) times the risk of outpatient visits \ndue to CRS, compared to the reference value of 32.9\u00b0C. Furthermore, the number \nof outpatient visits for childhood and younger individuals with CRS showed a \nnegative correlation with temperatures, whereas middle-aged individuals and \nolder adult individuals showed no such correlation.\nCONCLUSION: This study suggests that meteorological phenomena may have \ndetrimental effects on health, thereby contributing to a better understanding of \nthe environmental risk factors associated with this disease.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Guan, Xiang, Huang, Zhou and Zeng.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fpubh.2025.1621856\nPMCID: PMC12245921\nPMID: 40655206 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n35.

In multivariate analysis adjusted for age, \nthe significant factors associated with surgical intervention included complete \neyelid closure (odds ratio (OR)\u2009=\u20097.6; P\u2009<\u2009.001), ophthalmoplegia (OR\u2009=\u200914.2; \nP\u2009<\u2009.001), clinical exophthalmos (OR\u2009=\u200925.0; P\u2009<\u2009.001), CRP level >60\u2009mg/L \n(OR\u2009=\u20096.9; P\u2009=\u2009.006), leukocyte count >15,600\u2009g/L (OR\u2009=\u20097.7; P\u2009=\u2009.002), \nradiological exophthalmos (OR\u2009=\u20096.1; P\u2009=\u2009.001), retro-septal cellulitis \n(OR\u2009=\u20093.5; P\u2009=\u2009.02), posterior ethmoid opacification (OR\u2009=\u20096.1; P\u2009=\u2009.03), and \nabscess width >4\u2009mm (OR\u2009=\u20098.2; P\u2009=\u2009.01).Conclusions and RelevanceMany patients \ncan be managed medically. However, complete eyelid closure should prompt a CT \nscan. Exophthalmos, retro-septal cellulitis, or an abscess wider than 4\u2009mm is an \nindication for surgical drainage. Ophthalmoplegia should be interpreted in \ncontext. CRP level >60\u2009mg/L, a leukocyte count >15,600\u2009g/L, and posterior \nethmoid opacification should lead to close monitoring. These findings can aid in \ndeveloping a clinico-bio-radiological score to guide treatment decisions, \npotentially improving patient outcomes by standardizing care protocols.\n\nDOI: 10.1177/19160216251349444\nPMCID: PMC12256756\nPMID: 40652356 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe \nauthor(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the \nresearch, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\n\n37.

Electronic address: koma9dai@gmail.com.\n\nBACKGROUND: Nasogastric tube syndrome (NGTS) is a rare but potentially \nlife-threatening complication of nasogastric tube (NGT) placement. It is \ncharacterized by throat pain, hoarseness, and vocal cord paralysis. Awareness is \nessential for preventing severe airway compromise.\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year-old woman with pseudomyxoma peritonei developed \nNGTS while admitted to a palliative care unit with a prolonged NGT placement for \nintestinal obstruction. The patient presented with symptoms including throat \npain, otalgia, and subsequent hoarseness. Fiberoptic laryngoscopy revealed \nrestricted vocal cord abduction and posterior pharyngeal erythema. Despite the \noption of removing the NGT, it was retained due to ongoing drainage needs and \nthe absence of respiratory distress. Conservative management, including \ncorticosteroids, antibiotics, and proton pump inhibitors, led to symptom \nresolution.\nCONCLUSION: This case emphasizes the importance of recognizing NGTS, \nparticularly in palliative care settings, and highlights the need for vigilance \nfor atypical symptoms like otalgia. Conservative management may be effective in \nselected cases, underscoring the importance of individualized care and increased \nawareness among clinicians.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine.

Most cases are \nresolved by the age of 10 years, and it is rare in adults. PFAPA is \ncharacterized by recurrent episodes of fever associated with pharyngitis, \nstomatitis, and cervical adenitis, although not all clinical features are \npresent at initial evaluation. Diagnosis is made clinically, as there are no \nspecific biomarkers available. Treatment includes prednisone, colchicine, \ninterleukin-1 blockers, and tonsillectomy. We report a case of adult-onset PFAPA \nsyndrome that responded to colchicine. CASE REPORT A 22-year-old woman presented \nto the Rheumatology Clinic for evaluation of recurrent fevers associated with \nsore throat and enlarged painful cervical lymph nodes. She was symptom-free \nbetween the episodes. Workup for infectious causes and \nautoinflammatory/autoimmune diseases was unremarkable. Various differential \ndiagnoses were considered, due to her unusual presentation. After all were ruled \nout, PFAPA was diagnosed based on her symptoms, and she started steroids, to \nwhich she had a dramatic response and resolution of symptoms. She was then \ntransitioned to oral colchicine, which significantly decreased flare frequency. \nCONCLUSIONS Being aware of PFAPA syndrome in adults is vital. A timely diagnosis \ncan significantly improve a patient's quality of life. This case highlights the \nimportance of considering PFAPA syndrome in the differential diagnosis of \nperiodic febrile illnesses in adults and the role of Colchicine as prophylaxis. \nLarger studies are needed to understand etiopathogenesis better and develop \nother effective therapeutics.\n\nDOI: 10.12659/AJCR.943658\nPMCID: PMC11370285\nPMID: 39205369 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Conflict of interest: None declared\n\n\n41.

The subluxation occurs in the context of \nan infection in the ENT (\"Ear Nose and Throat\") region or following surgery. \nDiagnosis is based on clinical examination and radiological assessment. \nTreatment is typically medical and conservative, with surgical interventions \nreserved for recurrences and late presentations. We discuss here two cases of \nC1-C2 subluxation. The first case involves a 10-year-old child with subluxation \nfollowing a rhinopharyngitis. This presentation is the classical manifestation \nof Grisel's syndrome. Prompt management led to correction of the subluxation \nusing medical treatment and a soft Philadelphia collar. The second case involves \na 34-year-old adult who developed posterior headaches after sphenoidotomy \nsurgery. Grisel's syndrome is less common in adults, leading to clinical \nchallenges and delayed diagnosis (> 1 month). Reduction combined with a halo \nvest treatment failed, and the patient required cervical arthrodesis.\n\nPublisher: Le syndrome de Grisel est une subluxation atlanto-axo\u00efdienne (C1-C2) \nnon traumatique et l\u2019une des causes de torticolis chez l\u2019enfant.

A meta-analysis of single \nmeans, proportions, comparison of proportions, and mean differences with 95\u00a0% \nconfidence interval [CI] was conducted.\nRESULTS: Twenty-three articles (n\u00a0=\u00a01437) were included in the analysis. The \nmost common surgery was Sphincter Pharyngoplasty (SP), 62.6\u00a0% [31.3-88.9] for \nsyndromic and 76.3\u00a0% [37.5-98.9] for non-syndromic children. Among all surgical \ntechniques, for syndromic and non-syndromic children, 54.8\u00a0% [30.9-77.5] and \n73.9\u00a0% [61.3-84.6] obtained normal resonance post-operatively, respectively. \nSyndromic patients obtained normal resonance post-operatively in 83.3\u00a0% \n[57.7-96.6] of Combined Furlow Palatoplasty and Sphincter Pharyngoplasty (CPSP), \n72.6\u00a0% [54.5-87.5] of Pharyngeal Flap (PF), and 45.1\u00a0% [13.2-79.8] of Sphincter \nPharyngoplasty (SP) surgeries. Non-syndromic patients obtained normal resonance \npost-operatively in 79.2\u00a0% [66.4-88.8] of PF and 75.2\u00a0% [61.8-86.5] of SP \nsurgeries. The revision rate for syndromic and non-syndromic patients was 19.9\u00a0% \n[15.0-25.6] and 11.3\u00a0% [5.8-18.3], respectively. The difference was \nstatistically significant, 8.6\u00a0% [2.9-15.0, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003]. Syndromic patients who \nunderwent PF were least likely to undergo revision surgery as compared to SP and \nCPSP, 7.7\u00a0% [2.3-17.9] vs. 23.7\u00a0% [15.5-33.1] and 15.3\u00a0% [2.8-40.7], \nrespectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: Syndromic children had higher revision rates and were significantly \nless likely to obtain normal resonance following primary surgery than \nnon-syndromic patients. Among syndromic children, PF and CPSP have been shown to \nimprove resonance and reduce revision rates more so than SP alone.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.

Currently, the vast majority of patients who \nhave been identified with inability to belch have self-diagnosed the syndrome on \nthe basis of information available on the internet. A favorable response to \ninjection of botulinum toxin in the cricopharyngeus muscle is regarded as \nconfirmation of the diagnosis. In a mechanistic study in eight patients, absence \nof reflexogenic relaxation of the upper esophageal sphincter upon rapid gaseous \nesophageal distension was confirmed to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis \nof the syndrome.\nSUMMARY: The inability to belch syndrome, caused by failure of the upper \nesophageal sphincter to relax when the esophageal body is distended, clearly \nexists and may not be as rare as thought hitherto. However, overdiagnosis is \nalso likely to occur because the diagnosis is usually made on the basis of \nsymptoms only. The efficacy of botulinum toxin injection in the upper sphincter \nneeds to be assessed in double-blind placebo-controlled studies.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

It is \nclinically characterized by fever flares lasting 3-7 days, reappearing every 2-8 \nweeks with a distinctive clockwork regularity. PFAPA generally begins before 5 \nyears of age and usually ceases 3-5 years after onset. Recurrences may be \nobserved in adolescence and adulthood in up to 20% of cases. The authors aim to \ndescribe a case of PFAPA recurrence in adolescence temporally associated with \nallergen-specific immunotherapy (ASIT). A 16-year-old female patient was \nreferred to the rheumatology unit due to recurrent episodes of fever one month \nafter initiating ASIT for allergic rhinitis. These episodes occurred every 4 \nweeks and lasted 3 days. During these episodes, she also presented with a sore \nthroat, tonsillar exudates, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Abortive treatment \nwith oral prednisolone was attempted in these episodes, with complete resolution \nof fever after a single dose. After reviewing her medical background, she had \npreviously experienced febrile episodes accompanied by aphthous ulcers and \ntonsillar exudates occurring every 7-8 weeks from age 2-7. The etiopathogenesis \nof PFAPA remains uncertain. Environmental triggers, particularly those with \nimmunomodulator effects, may interfere with the immune responses responsible for \nPFAPA occurrence, but the mechanisms are still unclear. The authors describe the \nfirst report of the reappearance of PFAPA flares, possibly due to ASIT. Further \nstudies are needed to fully clarify if ASIT constitutes a true environmental \ntrigger of PFAPA.\n\nDOI: 10.4081/reumatismo.2023.1594\nPMID: 38115774 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n46.

Gardner is an assistant professor and director of the PA program at \nAlbany Medical College in Albany, N.Y. and works clinically in physical medicine \nand rehabilitation at Sunnyview Rehabilitation Hospital in Schenectady, N.Y. The \nauthor has disclosed no potential conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise.\n\nPeriodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome \nis, as the name implies, characterized by an extremely regular cycle of fevers \nthat is accompanied by one or more other symptoms such as oral ulcers, \npharyngitis, adenitis, tonsillitis, sore throat, cervical adenopathy, and \nheadache. Originally known as Marshall syndrome, PFAPA is most commonly \nidentified in children younger than age 5 years; however, adults may also \npresent with the disease, though they may report additional symptoms. PFAPA is \nnow understood to be a diagnosis of exclusion. Laboratory studies are typically \nunremarkable except for increases in acute phase reactants such as C-reactive \nprotein. Treatment is primarily supportive and most frequently uses systemic \nsteroids to suppress the inflammatory response. Acute flares are self-limited, \nand the syndrome typically resolves on its own as the child reaches age 7 or 8 \nyears.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 American Academy of Physician Associates.\n\nDOI: 10.1097/01.JAA.0000977712.81696.b9\nPMID: 37751263 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n47.

Results:The control group consisted of \n15 males and 5 females, with an apnea-hypopnea index \uff08AHI\uff09<5 events/h, while the \nOSAHS group comprised 26 males and 3 females with an AHI of 40.4\u00b123.1 events/h \nand the mean lowest arterial oxygen saturation \uff08LSaO\ue00c2\uff09 was 79.5% \u00b110.0%. In the \nboth groups, the vertical distance between the mandible and the posterior \npharyngeal wall decreased \uff08P<0.05\uff09; The long axis of tongue body decreased \n\uff08P<0.05\uff09, and the contact area between tongue and palate decreased. There was no \nsignificant change in the total volume of the retropalatine\uff08RP\uff09 and \nretroglossal\uff08RG\uff09 airway in the control group \uff08P>0.05\uff09. However, the minimum \ncross-sectional area and volume of the RP airway in OSAHS decreased \uff08P<0.001\uff09. \nThe lateral diameters of uvula plane in OSAHS decreased during mouth breathing, \nwhich was contrary to the trend in the control group \uff08P=0.017\uff09. The AHI of \npatients was positively correlated with the reduction of the volume of the RP \nairway during oral breathing \uff08P=0.001\uff09; The reduction of the distance between \nthe mandible and the posterior pharyngeal wall was positively correlated with \nthe length of the airway \uff08P<0.001\uff09. Conclusion:Mouth breathing leads to the \nshortening of the long axis of the tongue, the reduction of the contact area \nbetween the soft palate and the tongue, vertical distance between the mandible \nand the posterior pharyngeal wall, and the cross-sectional area of the \nepiglottis plane. These changes vary between OSAHS patients and controls. During \nmouth breathing, the diameters, areas and volumes of the RP area decreased, and \nwere more significant in severe cases.\n\nPublisher: \u76ee\u7684\uff1a\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u7ecf\u53e3\u6216\u7ecf\u9f3b\u547c\u5438\u65f6\uff0c\u963b\u585e\u6027\u7761\u7720\u547c\u5438\u6682\u505c\u4f4e\u901a\u6c14\u7efc\u5408\u5f81\uff08OSAHS\uff09\u60a3\u8005\u548c\u6b63\u5e38\u4eba\u7684\u54bd\u58c1\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5f62\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u3002 \n\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a29\u4f8b\u6210\u4ebaOSAHS\u60a3\u8005\u53ca20\u4f8b\u65e0\u9f3e\u5bf9\u7167\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u4e8e\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u6e05\u9192\u65f6\u53ca\u4f69\u6234\u9f3b\u5939\u7ecf\u53e3\u547c\u5438\u65f6\u884cMRI\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0a\u6c14\u9053\u7ed3\u6784\u6d4b\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u3002\u5206\u6790\uff1a\u2460\u65e0\u9f3e\u5bf9\u7167/OSAHS\u60a3\u8005\u53e3\u547c\u5438\u4e0e\u9f3b\u547c\u5438\u4e0a\u6c14\u9053\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u2461OSAHS\u60a3\u8005\u4e0e\u5bf9\u7167\u53e3\u547c\u5438\u65f6\u4e0a\u6c14\u9053\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u53ca\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u3002 \n\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u753715\u4f8b\uff0c\u59735\u4f8b\uff0c\u547c\u5438\u6682\u505c\u4f4e\u901a\u6c14\u6307\u6570\uff08AHI\uff09\u5747<5 \n\u6b21/h\u3002OSAHS\u60a3\u8005\u753726\u4f8b\uff0c\u59733\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747AHI\uff0840.4\u00b123.1\uff09\u6b21/h\uff0c\u7761\u7720\u65f6\u6700\u4f4e\u8840\u6c27\u9971\u548c\u5ea6\uff08LSaO\ue00c2\uff09\u5e73\u574779.5%\u00b110.0%\u3002\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u53caOSAHS\u53e3\u547c\u5438\u65f6\u5747\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e0b\u988c\u9aa8\u4e0e\u54bd\u540e\u58c1\u7684\u5782\u76f4\u8ddd\u79bb\u53d8\u5c0f\uff08P<0.05\uff09\uff1b\u820c\u4f53\u957f\u8f74\u51cf\u5c0f\uff08P<0.05\uff09\uff0c\u820c\u4f53\u4e0e\u8f6f\u3001\u786c\u816d\u63a5\u89e6\u533a\u57df\u51cf\u5c0f\u3002\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u8f6f\u816d\u540e\u53ca\u820c\u540e\u6c14\u9053\u603b\u5bb9\u79ef\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\uff08P>0.05\uff09\u3002\u800cOSAHS\u60a3\u8005\u8f6f\u816d\u540e\u6c14\u9053\u6700\u5c0f\u622a\u9762\u79ef\u3001\u6c14\u9053\u4f53\u79ef\u660e\u663e\u51cf\u5c0f\uff08P<0.001\uff09\u3002OSAHS\u60a3\u8005\u53e3\u547c\u5438\u65f6\u60ac\u96cd\u5782\u5e73\u9762\u5de6\u53f3\u5f84\u51cf\u5c0f\uff0c\u4e0e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u8d8b\u52bf\u76f8\u53cd\uff08P=0.017\uff09\u3002\u60a3\u8005\u7684AHI\u4e0e\u53e3\u547c\u5438\u65f6\u8f6f\u816d\u540e\u6c14\u9053\u5bb9\u79ef\u7684\u51cf\u5c0f\u91cf\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff08P=0.001\uff09\uff1b\u800c\u4e0b\u988c\u9aa8\u4e0e\u54bd\u540e\u58c1\u95f4\u8ddd\u7684\u51cf\u5c0f\u91cf\u4e0e\u6c14\u9053\u957f\u5ea6\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff08P<0.001\uff09\u3002 \n\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a\u53e3\u547c\u5438\u5bfc\u81f4\u820c\u4f53\u957f\u8f74\u7f29\u77ed\u3001\u8f6f\u816d\u4e0e\u820c\u4f53\u63a5\u89e6\u9762\u79ef\u51cf\u5c0f\uff0c\u4e0b\u988c\u9aa8\u4e0e\u54bd\u540e\u58c1\u7684\u5782\u76f4\u8ddd\u79bb\u51cf\u5c0f\u3001\u4f1a\u538c\u5e73\u9762\u622a\u9762\u79ef\u964d\u4f4e\u3002OSAHS\u60a3\u8005\u4e0e\u5bf9\u7167\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u7279\u70b9\u5b58\u5728\u8f83\u5927\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u53e3\u547c\u5438\u65f6\u60a3\u8005\u8f6f\u816d\u540e\u6c14\u9053\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u5f84\u7ebf\u3001\u9762\u79ef\u53ca\u4f53\u79ef\u51cf\u5c0f\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u91cd\u5ea6\u60a3\u8005\u66f4\u663e\u8457\u3002.\n\nCopyright\u00a9 by the Editorial Department of Journal of Clinical \nOtorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery.\n\nDOI: 10.13201/j.issn.2096-7993.2023.07.005\nPMCID: PMC10570098\nPMID: 37549944 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors of this article and the planning \ncommittee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with \ncommercial interests to disclose.\n\n\n48.

According to this medical \nclassic, it is originally used in the treatment of the Shaoyang and Yangming \nsyndrome. Based on the modern pathophysiological mechanism, this study \ninterpreted the classic provisions of Chaihu Jia Longgu Muli Decoction. Original \nrecords of &quot;chest fullness&quot; &quot;annoyance&quot; &quot;shock&quot; \n&quot;difficult urination&quot; &quot;delirium&quot; &quot;heavy body and \nfailing to turn over&quot; all have profound pathophysiological basis, involving \ndisorders in cardiovascular, respiratory, nervous, and mental systems. This \nformula is widely used, which can be applied to treat epilepsy, cerebral \narteriosclerosis, cerebral infarction, and other cerebrovascular diseases, \nhypertension, arrhythmia, and other cardiovascular diseases, insomnia, \nconstipation, anxiety, depression, cardiac neurosis and other acute and chronic \ndiseases as well as diseases in psychosomatic medicine. The clinical indications \ninclude Bupleuri Radix-targeted syndrome such as fullness and discomfort in \nchest and hypochondrium, bitter taste mouth, dry throat, and dizziness, the \ninsomnia, anxiety, depression, susceptibility to fright, upset, dreamfulness and \nother psychiatric symptoms, red tongue, thick and yellow tongue coating, and \nwiry hard and powerful pulse. This formula was found to be used in combination \nwith other formulas, such as Gualou Xiebai Decoction, Wendan Decoction, Zhizhu \nPills, Juzhijiang Decoction, Suanzaoren Decoction, and Banxia Baizhu Tianma \nDecoction.\n\nDOI: 10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20230206.501\nPMID: 37282922 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"}
