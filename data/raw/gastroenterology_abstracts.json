Metabolic dysfunction-associated \nsteatohepatitis (MASH), a progressive form of MASLD, can lead to fibrosis and \ncirrhosis. The incidence and burden of MASH in Germany are expected to double by \n2030, while diagnostic and management challenges persist. Expert consensus on \ndiagnostic strategies and treatment modalities in MASLD and MASH is required.\nOBJECTIVES: The panel aimed to gather insights and consensus on the diagnostic \npathway and current treatment modalities for MASH in Germany.\nMETHODS: A three-round web-based survey, integrating Delphi panel methodology \nwith a standard survey, was conducted from February to May 2024 to reach \nconsensus on predefined questions. The survey involved 12 gastroenterology, \ndiabetology and/or hepatology specialists in Germany.\nRESULTS: The Delphi panel revealed that ~75% of MASH patients in Germany remain \nundiagnosed. Non-invasive measures, such as fibrosis scores (values from \nclinical and imaging tests to assess fibrosis), liver enzyme tests and liver \nstiffness measurement, were primary methods for diagnosing and monitoring MASH \npatients. Lifestyle modifications were the primary management strategy, given \nthe absence of approved pharmacological treatments for MASH. The panel also \nhighlighted significant challenges in managing MASH, including the lack of \napproved medications and the difficulty in sustaining lifestyle changes.\nCONCLUSIONS: The survey underscores the substantial underdiagnosis of MASH and \nthe reliance on non-invasive diagnostic methods in Germany. The lack of approved \ntreatments necessitates a focus on lifestyle modifications and comorbidity \nmanagement. The Delphi panel's insights call for enhanced screening, early \ndetection and standardised algorithms to improve patient outcomes.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

Traditional episodic \ncare models provide static snapshots of a patient's condition, limiting the \nability to address dynamic changes in clinical status. Emerging at-home \nmonitoring technologies and wearable devices present numerous opportunities to \ngenerate continuous clinical data, but the integration of this data into \nclinical workflows remains challenging. Large language models (LLMs) and \ngenerative AI (GenAI) technologies offer innovative solutions by enabling the \nacquisition, summarization, and actionable analysis of multimodal data generated \nby patients. This review explores the application of home-monitoring \ntechnologies for key complications of cirrhosis, including HE, ascites, and \nfrailty. GenAI will enable the integration of these home-based data with \ncanonical clinical data acquisition. We discuss the role of GenAI technologies \nand LLMs in processing multimodal data, supporting clinical decision-making, and \ncreating autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents capable of triaging and \nsummarizing patient data. In addition, we offer perspectives on the clinical \nevaluation of these emerging technologies. Finally, we close with a \n\"not-so-distant\" vision of GenAI-enabled at-home cirrhosis care.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

Our aim \nwas to assess the ability of ChatGPT 4.0 to deliver high-quality information in \nresponse to commonly asked questions and management recommendations for \nBarrett's esophagus (BE). Twenty-nine questions (14 clinical vignettes and 15 \nfrequently asked questions (FAQ)) on BE were entered into ChatGPT 4.0. Using a \n5-point Likert scale, three gastroenterologists with expertise in BE rated the \n29 ChatGPT responses for accuracy, completeness, empathy, use of excessive \nmedical jargon, and appropriateness to send to patients. Three separate \ngastroenterologists generated responses to the same 15 FAQs on BE. A group of \nblinded patients with BE evaluated both ChatGPT and gastroenterologist responses \non quality, clarity, empathy and which of the two responses was preferred. \nGastroenterologists rated ChatGPT responses as mostly accurate overall (4.01 out \nof 5) with 79.3% of responses completely accurate or mostly accurate with minor \nerrors. When compared to gastroenterologist responses, the patient panel rated \nChatGPT responses to be of significantly higher quality (4.42 vs. 3.07 out of 5) \nand empathy (4.33 vs. 2.55 out of 5) (p\u00a0<\u20090.0001). In conclusion, ChatGPT 4.0 \nprovides generally accurate and comprehensive information about BE. Patients \nexpressed a clear preference for ChatGPT responses over those of \ngastroenterologists, finding responses from ChatGPT to be of higher quality and \nempathy. This study highlights the potential use of ChatGPT 4.0 as an adjunctive \ntool for physicians to provide real-time, high-quality information about BE to \ntheir patients.\n\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2025.

Endoscopy now provides a wide variety of non-invasive \ntreatments, and it prevents upper and lower gastrointestinal cancer. Performing \nhigh-quality endoscopy requires a complex blend of cognitive, technical and \nnon-technical skills. For an individual to acquire these skills requires \nhigh-quality training. Unfortunately, the development of training has lagged the \nadvances in technology, resulting in unwarranted variation in the effectiveness \nof the technology. This chapter argues that to enable a more uniform \nhigh-quality endoscopic service, the solution is to improve endoscopy training. \nIt describes what constitutes high-quality training, how new methods of training \nwill improve the traditional training pathway and what can be done to transform \nendoscopy training.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

Through deep learning, radiomics, and \nmultimodal data integration, AI has achieved diagnostic parity with expert \nclinicians in endoscopic image analysis (e.g., early gastric cancer detection, \ncolorectal polyp identification) and non-invasive assessment of liver \npathologies (e.g., fibrosis staging, fatty liver typing) while demonstrating \nutility in personalized care scenarios such as predicting hepatocellular \ncarcinoma recurrence and optimizing inflammatory bowel disease treatment \nresponses. Despite these advancements challenges persist including limited model \ngeneralization due to fragmented datasets, algorithmic limitations in rare \nconditions (e.g., pediatric liver diseases) caused by insufficient training \ndata, and unresolved ethical issues related to bias, accountability, and patient \nprivacy. Mitigation strategies involve constructing standardized multicenter \ndatabases, validating AI tools through prospective trials, leveraging federated \nlearning to address data scarcity, and developing interpretable systems (e.g., \nattention heatmap visualization) to enhance clinical trust. Integrating \ngenerative AI, digital twin technologies, and establishing unified \nethical/regulatory frameworks will accelerate AI adoption in primary care and \nfoster equitable healthcare access while interdisciplinary collaboration and \nevidence-based implementation remain critical for realizing AI's potential to \nredefine precision care for digestive disorders, improve global health outcomes, \nand reshape healthcare equity.\n\n\u00a9The Author(s) 2025.

Scarcity of \nrecognition, knowledge and training leading to the underdiagnosis of these \nconditions is associated with increased referrals to gastroenterologists or \nemergency room visits, along with a dramatic rise in healthcare costs and \nimpaired quality of life. Despite advances in endoscopy and radiology, motility \nand pH impedance procedures remain the cornerstone of an accurate \"Disorders of \nGut-Brain Interaction\" diagnosis, but these procedures need to be performed by \nwell-trained personnel in a dedicated motility unit, with high-performance \nequipment. The primary motility procedures include high-resolution esophageal \nmanometry and pH monitoring for esophageal function, high-resolution anorectal \nmanometry and balloon expulsion tests for anorectal function, as well as \nhydrogen/methane breath tests for identifying dysbiosis and food intolerances. \nThe purpose of this article is to highlight the importance of establishing a \nNeurogastroenterology and Motility Unit, and to provide an up-to-date overview \non the main issues encountered when setting up a motility laboratory in the \ncommunity or academic practice, including considerations for personnel training, \nequipment, and commonly performed motility procedures and their clinical \nusefulness.\n\nDOI: 10.15403/jgld-6126\nPMID: 40580522 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n7.

These updated guidelines aim to complement the \nIBD standards and promote the use of the national primary care diagnostic \npathway for lower gastrointestinal symptoms to enhance diagnostic accuracy and \ntimeliness. Formulated through a systematic and transparent process, this \ndocument reflects a consensus of best practices based on current evidence. The \nguideline, while developed primarily for the UK, is structured to support IBD \nmanagement internationally. It is endorsed by the BSG executive board and CSSC \nwithout external commercial funding, with involvement primarily supported \nthrough professional roles in public institutions and the National Health \nService (NHS). Methodological revisions since the prior guidelines have enhanced \nrigor in technical review and development, with methodology details published \nindependently following peer review. In developing the recommendations, 89 \nclinical experts and stakeholders participated in an online survey, identifying \nprimary outcomes, such as clinical and endoscopic remission, as well as adverse \nevent metrics, all stratified by clinically relevant effect sizes. These \nguidelines are intended to support clinical decision-making but are not \nprescriptive, recognizing that individual clinical scenarios may warrant \ntailored approaches. Further research may inform future revisions as new \nevidence emerges.\n\n\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No \ncommercial re-use.

Swallowing difficulties are classified into \noropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) and esophageal dysphagia. Despite its clinical \nimportance, dysphagia is associated with several uncertainties regarding its \noptimal diagnostic work-up and management, particularly, considering the \nprogress with diagnostic modalities and technologies. A Delphi consensus was \nperformed with experts from various disciplines who conducted a literature \nsummary and voting process on 41 statements. Quality of evidence was evaluated \nusing the grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation \ncriteria. Consensus was reached for all the statements. The panel agreed with \nthe definition and prevalence of esophageal and OD types. The role of endoscopy, \nhigh-resolution manometry, EndoFLIP, barium swallow and other imaging tests in \nevaluating esophageal dysphagia has reached overall strong agreement. \nVideofluoroscopic swallow study, alongside fiber-endoscopic evaluation of \nswallowing, as the methods of choice for the instrumental assessment of \noropharyngeal dysfunction is a strong recommendation. Regarding treatment, a \nweak recommendation was achieved for the use of PPIs, calcium-channel blockers, \nnitrates, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, antidepressants or peppermint oil \nfor the treatment of hypercontractile esophagus. A strong recommendation exists \nfor endoscopic and surgical treatment of achalasia, while a weak recommendation \nis provided for other esophageal motility disorders. Regarding OD, a weak \nrecommendation was achieved for swallow therapy, to improve swallowing \nmechanics, reduce symptoms, and enhance quality of life. Swallow therapy could \nbe more effective when using validated assessment tools, consistent treatment \nparameters, and considering long-term follow-up. A multinational group of \nEuropean experts summarized the current state of consensus on the definition, \ndiagnosis, and management of dysphagia.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

Commercial claims covering more \nthan 50 million enrollees were used to calculate price, spending, utilization, \nand quality measures from 2012 to 2021. The data were analyzed between April \n2024 and September 2024.\nEXPOSURES: PE acquisition of gastroenterology practices.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were price, spending per \nphysician, number of colonoscopies per physician, number of unique patients per \nphysician, and quality (polypectomy detection, incomplete colonoscopies, and 4 \nadverse event measures: cardiovascular, serious gastroenterology, nonserious \ngastroenterology, and any adverse event).\nRESULTS: Data from more than 1.1 million patients (mean [SD] age, 47.1 [8.4] \nyears; 47.8% male patients) undergoing 1.3 million colonoscopies were analyzed. \nThe sample included 718\u202f851 treated colonoscopies conducted by 1494 physicians \namong 590\u202f900 patients across 1240 PE-acquired practice sites and 637\u202f990 \ncontrol colonoscopies conducted by 2550 physicians among 527\u202f380 patients across \n2657 independent practice sites. Colonoscopy prices at PE-acquired \ngastroenterology practices increased by 4.5% (95% CI, 2.5%-6.6%; P\u2009<\u2009.001) \nrelative to independent gastroenterology practices. The estimated price effect \nincreased to 6.7% (95% CI, 4.2%-9.3%; P\u2009<\u2009.001) when considering only \ncolonoscopies performed by gastroenterologists in PE-acquired practices with \nmarket shares above the 75th percentile (24.4%) in 2021 as treated. Colonoscopy \nspending per physician increased by 16.0% (95% CI, 8.4%-24.0%; P\u2009<\u2009.001), while \nthe number of colonoscopies and the number of unique patients per physician \nincreased by 12.1% (95% CI, 5.3%-19.4%; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and 11.3% (95% CI, 4.4%-18.5%; \nP\u2009<\u2009.001), respectively; however, these spending and utilization measures were \nalready increasing prior to PE acquisition. No statistically significant \nassociations were detected for the 6 quality measures analyzed.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this economic evaluation, PE acquisition of \ngastroenterology practices led to higher prices and spending but had no \ndiscernible effect on quality. Policymakers may be well advised to monitor PE \ninvestment in physician practices given the increase in prices and spending \nwithout a commensurate increase in quality.\n\nDOI: 10.1001/jamahealthforum.2025.1476\nPMCID: PMC12181784\nPMID: 40540284 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Arnold \nreported grants from Arnold Ventures during the conduct of the study.

Little is known about how specialists perceive and manage liver \nenzyme abnormalities. This study investigates the current practice and \neducational needs of IBD specialists in the management of liver enzyme \nabnormalities.\nMETHODS: A 22-question web-based survey was distributed to members of the \nItalian Group for the study of IBD, covering their demographics, workplace \nfeatures, and approaches to managing liver enzyme abnormalities in IBD patients.\nRESULTS: The survey was completed by 205/439 (46.7%) respondents. The majority \nof respondents were over 45 years old (38.5%) and worked in Northern Italy \n(61%). Most were gastroenterologists (86%) practicing in public hospitals (45%), \nwith 21.5% having a defined referral pathway to a dedicated liver unit for IBD \npatients. Ninety-seven percent of physicians reported regular monitoring of \ntransaminases, while 88% also monitored gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and 76% \nalkaline phosphatase (ALP). In cases of abnormal enzyme levels, over 70% \nreported ordering additional diagnostic tests independently, with notable \nheterogeneity in the thresholds used to trigger further investigation. The \nconditions most frequently suspected in cases of mild transaminase elevations \nwere metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (71%) and \ndrug-induced liver injury (17%). A significant proportion of physicians (57%) \nconsidered their training in managing liver enzyme abnormalities adequate but \nacknowledged the need for further educational opportunities. The main barrier \nidentified was the lack of specific guidelines and actionable flowcharts (62%).\nCONCLUSION: This survey reveals heterogeneity in monitoring and management of \nliver enzyme abnormalities among IBD specialists. Most physicians recognize the \nneed for improved training and specific guidelines.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Six gastroenterology fellows with <150 \nprior colonoscopies received standardised training before performing elective \nscreening colonoscopies using either WAC or CC techniques. Patients were \nrandomly assigned to WAC or CC groups. The primary outcome was caecal intubation \ntime (CIT). Secondary outcomes included technical failure, procedural \ndifficulty, patient discomfort, complications, withdrawal time and adenoma \ndetection rate (ADR).\nRESULTS: Of 250 randomised patients, 230 completed the protocol (WAC, n=113; CC, \nn=117). Mean CIT was comparable between groups (10.6\u00b14.2\u2009min vs 9.8\u00b13.9\u2009min; \np=0.35). Technical failure occurred in 6.2% of WAC and 5.1% of CC procedures, \nwith no significant differences in procedural difficulty ratings, analgesic \nrequirements or patient discomfort scores. ADR was similar between arms (40.7% \nvs 33.3%; p=0.25). Learning curves demonstrated parallel, progressive reductions \nin CIT among fellows in both groups.\nCONCLUSION: WAC is a safe and effective alternative to CC for novice \nendoscopists, with similar procedure times, learning curves and safety profiles. \nThese findings support the inclusion of WAC in gastroenterology training \nprogrammes.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: TCTR20230324001.\n\n\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

There is \ninsufficient documented evidence about the problems and needs of patients and \nphysicians in managing NAFLD. This study aimed to explore the challenges and \nneeds in managing NAFLD from the perspective of gastroenterology and hepatology \n(GH) specialists.\nMETHODS: This qualitative study was conducted from January to September 2023. \nFifteen Iranian GH specialists selected by purposive sampling. Data were \ncollected through semi-structured interviews. The interviews were analyzed \ninductively using the Elo and Kyngas content analysis approach. The criteria \nproposed by Guba and Lincoln were used to ensure the study's validity.\nRESULTS: The identified challenges were divided into thirteen main categories \n(34 subcategories and 117 primary codes), and the identified needs were divided \ninto eight main categories (21 subcategories and 97 primary codes). The main \ncategories of the challenges were chronic nature and time-consuming differential \ndiagnosis, complex treatment process, defects in the patient management process, \nshortcomings of the healthcare system, the effect of unhealthy eating and \ncultural and social factors on the diet, incorrect attitude of patients, lack of \nknowledge and awareness of patients, lack of comprehensive treatment plans based \non patients' conditions, defect in knowledge and awareness of physicians, \ninadequate cooperation of patients, defects in the process of recording and \nmonitoring information and providing feedback, insufficient policies and plans \nin the prevention of NAFLD, and economic problems. The main categories of needs \nincluded developing a comprehensive treatment plan, updating physicians' \nknowledge and creating standard treatment protocols, changing attitudes and \nempowering patients, informing and educating patients, establishing \nmulti-specialty clinics for NAFLD treatment, establishing peer support groups \nand facilitating communication, utilizing digital technology to track patient \ninformation and monitor their progress, and supportive, educational, prevention, \nand management policies in the treatment of NAFLD.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study showed that managing NAFLD involves physical, \npsychological, nutritional, sports, economic, and social aspects and requires \nmultidisciplinary clinical approaches, digital technologies, and supportive and \neducational policies. These findings have important implications that can help \npatients, physicians, and policymakers design better lifestyle prescriptions to \nmanage NAFLD.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Not only does this apply to the medical \nmanagement of IBD but also to its surgical management. This review aims to \nhighlight the major updates in the current surgical approach in Crohn's disease.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Surgery for Crohn's disease is no longer considered only for \nmedically refractory disease or for disease-related complications but can rather \nbe considered as an effective first-line treatment option. The concept of \nmultimodal prehabilitation is becoming more solidified in Crohn's disease, as \nstrong evidence continues to indicate its positive impact on surgical outcomes. \nThe impact of the mesentery as well as the type of surgical anastomosis on \npostsurgical Crohn's disease recurrence is being closely reexamined. The optimal \napproach for surgical management of perianal Crohn's disease is also being \nredefined.\nSUMMARY: Surgery is an integral part of the care of Crohn's disease patients and \nkeeping up with the evolving paradigm of surgery in Crohn's disease is critical \nfor all providers taking care of Crohn's disease patients to ensure patients are \ngetting the best care possible.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The impact of various factors, including trainees' \ncharacteristics, working conditions, and EUS procedure numbers during training \nwas analyzed.\nRESULTS: 65 valid questionnaires were categorized into two groups based on the \nmedian number of EUS procedures performed by trainees within one year \npost-training: a group with fewer EUS cases (<\u200930 cases) and a group with more \nEUS cases (\u2265\u200930 cases). Significant differences were found in annual EUS \nprocedures (P\u2009<\u20090.001), endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration \n(EUS-FNA) cases (P\u2009<\u20090.001), and complete scan rates (P\u2009=\u20090.007). Favorable \nconditions for trainees in performing EUS included higher-level hospitals \n(P\u2009=\u20090.001), more hospital beds (P\u2009=\u20090.015) and department beds (P\u2009=\u20090.033), \ngreater annual endoscopy volume (P\u2009<\u20090.001), a longer prior duration of the use \nof EUS on the hospital (P\u2009=\u20090.003), higher departmental EUS volume (P\u2009<\u20090.001) \nand presence of established staff endosonographers (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Additionally, \ntrainees in the group with more EUS cases had more guidance from experienced \ncolleagues (P\u2009=\u20090.009). Multivariate logistic regression analysis highlighted \nannual endoscopy volume and EUS volume as independent influencing factors.\nCONCLUSION: Tertiary hospitals with larger bed capacities and high endoscopy \nvolumes foster optimal EUS skill development among trainees. Moreover, factors \nsuch as longer duration of EUS implementation, increased caseload and guidance \nfrom experienced colleagues all contribute to the professional growth of \ntrainees.\nCLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have shown \npromise in enhancing survival, but they are associated with immune-related \nadverse events, including potentially life-threatening myocarditis. Moreover, \nICI-induced myocarditis can be asymptomatic, necessitating early diagnosis. \nSpecific risk factors and biomarkers for esophageal cancer remain poorly \ncharacterized.\nAIM: To investigate the determinants of ICI-associated asymptomatic myocarditis \nin patients with esophageal cancer and explore potential early biomarkers.\nMETHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 202 cancer patients who \nreceived treatment at Shanxi Province Cancer Hospital from July 2019 to July \n2024.\nRESULTS: Older age, male gender, and elevated creatine kinase isoenzymes (CK-MB) \nand CK levels were found to be significant risk factors for asymptomatic \nmyocarditis. The myocarditis occurrence group had higher CK-MB (3.05 ng/mL vs \n5.02 ng/mL; P < 0.001) and CK levels (187.29 U/L vs 212.25 U/L; P = 0.005), and \nthe predictive value of age, gender, CK, and CK-MB was low [are under the \nreceiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.579-0.608]. However, their \ncombination in a predictive model showed improved diagnostic capability, with an \nAUC of 0.808.\nCONCLUSION: Age, gender, and cardiac biomarker levels considerably contribute to \nthe risk of ICI-related myocarditis in patients with esophageal cancer. The \nintegration of these factors into a predictive model enhances early diagnosis, \nfacilitating personalized risk management.\n\n\u00a9The Author(s) 2025.

The \nprevailing explanation attributes the chronic recurring episodes of bloody \ndiarrhea and abdominal pain to some form of immune abnormality, despite the lack \nof supporting evidence. This highlights the critical need for innovative \nresearch directions and methodologies to uncover the cause and develop a cure \nfor this disease. By analyzing existing data from less than a dozen previously \npublished studies, a novel, evidence-based pathogenesis was constructed, \nimplicating colonic epithelial hydrogen peroxide as a causal factor in the \ndevelopment of this disease. This newly identified mechanism informed the \ncreation of a groundbreaking class of therapeutics, known as reducing agents, \nwhich have demonstrated remarkable success in resolving colonic inflammation and \nrestoring colonic health in patients with refractory ulcerative colitis.

The present study was thus developed to explore the \nmechanistic importance of HDAC10 as a regulator of CRC.\nAIM: To investigate the impact of HDAC10 on tumor growth and its regulation in \ntumor microenvironment (TME) in CRC, we conducted this study.\nMETHODS: The study evaluated HDAC10 expression using immunohistochemistry \nanalyses and assessed its prognostic value in CRC patients. HDAC10 depletion CRC \ncell lines were generated, and its biological functions were assessed through \ncell counting kit-8, wound healing, and colony formation assays. Furthermore, \ngene set variation analysis (GSVA) was employed to explore the potential \nmolecular mechanisms of HDAC10 in CRC. The impact of HDAC10 on TME was \nsubsequently assessed. Finally, the study investigated the influence of HDAC10 \non the response to immunotherapy and chemotherapeutic drugs in CRC.\nRESULTS: HDAC10 expression was significantly elevated in CRC and correlated with \npoor prognosis in patients. Knockdown of HDAC10 reduced colon cancer cell \nproliferation and migration capabilities. GSVA revealed a strong association \nbetween high HDAC10 expression and immune suppression. Additionally, high HDAC10 \nlevels were correlated with a non-inflamed TME. Finally, patients with high \nHDAC10 expression showed reduced sensitivity to immunotherapy.\nCONCLUSION: This study revealed the significance of HDAC10 in TME, therapy \nefficacy, and clinical prognosis in CRC, offering novel insights for therapeutic \nadvancements in CRC.\n\n\u00a9The Author(s) 2025.

Despite \nthese advantages, the lack of standardised criteria for defining and appraising \nradiologic disease activity on MRE has contributed to variability in \ninterpretation and clinical application. In response, multiple MRE-based scoring \nsystems have been developed to quantify radiological Crohn's disease activity in \nboth luminal and post-operative settings. Radiological disease activity scores \nspecific to luminal Crohn's disease include the magnetic resonance index of \nactivity (MaRIA), simplified MaRIA, Nancy score, London score, Crohn's disease \nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) index, Clermont score, paediatric inflammatory \nCrohn's MRE index, MRE global score, MRE index, and modified Clermont score. The \nMR score and the MRI in Crohn's disease to predict postoperative recurrence \nindex have been specifically developed to evaluate post-operative disease \nrecurrence in Crohn's disease. Nevertheless, heterogeneity in scoring \nparameters, variability in computational complexity, and a lack of consensus \nregarding optimal score selection, have impeded widespread clinical adoption of \nradiological disease activity scores. This narrative review aims to summarise \nthe key imaging features of luminal Crohn's disease, explore their integration \ninto existing MRE scoring indices, and critically compare the structure, \nstrengths, and clinical applicability of each. Furthermore, MRI scores specific \nto post-operative Crohn's disease evaluation, and the assessment of cumulative \nbowel wall damage using the Lemann index will also be discussed.\n\n\u00a9The Author(s) 2025.

However, its therapeutic effects and mechanisms in \nulcerative colitis (UC) remain unclear.\nAIM: To investigate the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of KSCI in \nalleviating UC.\nMETHODS: Therapeutic targets for KSCI in treating UC were identified using \nnetwork pharmacology. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations confirmed the \ninteractions between KSCI and these targets. In a murine UC model induced by \ndextran sodium sulfate (DSS), the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of \nKSCI were evaluated following oral administration, as well as its impact on \nintestinal barrier function and immune response modulation. Finally, changes in \ngut microbiota composition were analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing.\nRESULTS: A total of 192 potential targets of KSCI in treating UC were identified \nusing network pharmacology. KSCI bound stably to core targets including protein \nkinase B (AKT), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), NOD-like \nreceptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3 (NLRP3), phosphoinositide \n3-kinase (PI3K), forkhead box O1 (FOXO1), and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). The \noral administration of KSCI improved colon length and body weight, and reduced \ndisease activity in a mouse model of DSS-induced UC. KSCI suppressed \npro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL-1\u03b2], IL-6, IL-17, and tumor necrosis \nfactor alpha) and promoted the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine \nIL-10. It also inhibited key signaling molecules and modulated the expression of \nIL-1\u03b2, AKT, p38 MAPK, NLRP3, PI3K, AKT, FOXO1, and TLR4. KSCI exhibited potent \nantioxidant effects, ameliorating colonic inflammation and tissue damage. It \nimproved intestinal barrier function, influenced gut microbiota composition, and \nincreased splenic T-cell percentages.\nCONCLUSION: KSCI alleviated DSS-induced UC by modulating gut microbiota, \nenhancing the intestinal barrier, reducing inflammation and oxidative stress, \nand regulating the immune response.\n\n\u00a9The Author(s) 2025.

They also exhibit a high \ndegree of plasticity. In the last two decades there has been a strong \nassociation established between CAFs and colorectal carcinoma (CRC). However, \nthere are no comprehensive statistics on CRC or CAFs, and the potential \ndirections for research.\nMETHODS: The study performed a literature review spanning from January 1, 2004, \nto March 27, 2025, within the Web of Science Core Collection Database. VOSviewer \nand CiteSpace software were used to perform bibliometric analysis and \nvisualization. Microsoft Excel and R was also utilized.\nRESULTS: The analysis included 1145 articles. The articles in question were \npublished across 359 different journals, and included 4032 keywords. The number \nof publications increased significantly between 2010 and 2025. China was the \nleading contributor to the total number of publications, and the United States \nled the global list of citations. Sun Yat-sen University and Shanghai Jiao Tong \nUniversity are renowned research institutions. Notable researchers such as De \nWever, Olivier and Bracke, Marc from Ghent University Hospital, and Pena, \nCristina from Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda University Hospital are among the \nmost productive and highly cited authors. CANCERS has the most publications, and \nthe highest citation rate. CAFs are a major focus of research in CRC. This \nincludes the effect of CAFs, such as on cell proliferation and angiogenesis.\nCONCLUSION: This study uses bibliometric analyses to present a comprehensive \nview of research in CAFs, CRCs from 2004 until March 27, 2025. The study \nhighlights important research areas, anticipates future directions and offers \nvaluable insights to future efforts in the field.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Qian, Ren, Zhu, Chen, Shen, Hu and Chen.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1618742\nPMCID: PMC12267271\nPMID: 40677714 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n23.

Our study analyzed the \ndifferential ITM in GC tissues and identified nine bacterial genera \nsignificantly associated with overall survival (OS), with seven as risk factors \nand two as protective factors. Three distinct clusters with varying survival \noutcomes were defined, demonstrating correlations with pathological stage and \nimmune features. An immune-related gene-based RiskScore model incorporating \ngenes such as Apolipoprotein D (APOD), Stanniocalcin 1 (STC1), Coagulation \nFactor II Thrombin Receptor (F2R), Angiotensinogen (AGT), Fatty Acid Binding \nProtein 4 (FABP4), Inhibin Subunit Beta A (INHBA), Caspase Recruitment Domain \nFamily Member 11 (CARD11), and Dickkopf WNT Signaling Pathway Inhibitor 1 (DKK1) \nwas established and validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene \nExpression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. When combined with clinical factors, this \nRiskScore model formed a Nomogram model achieving Areas Under the Curve (AUCs) \nof 0.72, 0.76, and 0.79 for 1, 3, and 5-year OS predictions, respectively. This \nmodel exhibited robust predictive accuracy over time and correlated with \nmutation frequency, drug sensitivity, and immunotherapy response. Furthermore, \nsingle-cell analysis revealed that tumor-associated fibroblasts may play a \npivotal role in immune-microbial interactions. The results were confirmed using \nquantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry \n(IHC). In conclusion, the prognostic model incorporating ITM and immune-related \ngenes aids in risk stratification and provides valuable insights and targets for \nGC treatment.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Jin, Ji, Bai, Su, Ke, Liu and Wang.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1622959\nPMCID: PMC12267262\nPMID: 40677704 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n24.

However, further \ninvestigation is required to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which the \nmicrobial community or specific bacteria contribute to carcinogenesis. The \npresent work deals with the isolation and identification of bacteria from nine \nCRC biopsy samples and nine adjacent normal biopsy samples. Different media, \nsuch as brain heart infusion (BHI), anaerobic basal agar (ABA), and trypticase \nsoy agar (TSA), and culture conditions have been manipulated to maximize the \nisolation of bacteria residing in biopsy samples. A total of 75 bacteria were \nisolated from the tumor and adjacent site. Enterococcus, Escherichia, \nKlebsiella, Shigella, Citrobacter, Morganella, and Veillonella have been found \nto be enriched in most of the tumor biopsies, while biopsies collected from \nadjacent tissues had Escherichia, Shigella, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus \nbacteria. A culture-based approach to assessing bacterial diversity offer \nadvantages, enabling the study of individual bacteria to elucidate mechanisms of \nintestinal carcinogenesis.

Cryptosporidiosis is an infectious parasitic disease that \ncauses diarrhoea, and rapid diagnosis plays a critical role in initiating timely \ntreatment. A method for diagnosing cryptosporidiosis involves detecting oocysts \nexcreted in faeces using a light microscope with an appropriate staining method. \nHowever, transporting samples to a laboratory often takes time, during which the \nanimal's health may deteriorate. The developed portable microscope provides up \nto 1000x magnification, enabling the diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis using the \ncarbol fuchsin staining method. It is compatible with almost any smartphone and \ndoes not require additional digital or optical magnification. Through an \nintegrated mobile telemedicine application, veterinarians can instantly consult \nspecialists by transmitting patient information and images. Calibration tests \nhave demonstrated that the system can generate high-resolution images of \noocysts. This innovative microscope is a crucial tool for veterinarians working \nin the field, allowing for rapid detection of Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts, \nreducing neonatal calf mortality, and preventing the spread of infectious \ndiseases.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

There is increasing \nevidence of the potential role of diet as therapy in IBD. We conducted a survey \nnearly a decade ago assessing the perspectives of patients and clinicians on \ndiet and IBD and found that whilst patients believed diet was important for IBD, \nclinicians had heterogeneous views. This study aimed to determine whether those \nviews have changed over time.\nMETHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in Australia targeting members of \nnational IBD organisations-one survey was sent to patients, the other sent to \nclinicians. The questionnaires collected data on demographics, disease \nphenotype, dietary awareness and beliefs. Responses were compared to the index \nsurvey responses using the \u03c72 or Fisher's exact tests.\nRESULTS: Eighty-two patients completed the survey (72% female; median age 40; \n52% Crohn's disease; 47% ulcerative colitis). Most (89%) felt diet was important \nto their IBD. Almost half (49%) felt their diet could be improved and 39% had \nnot seen a dietitian. Compared to the index survey, current patients were more \nlikely to believe diet affects their IBD (78% vs. 89%, p\u2009=\u20090.019). Fifty \nclinicians (gastroenterologists, dietitians, surgeons and nurses) completed the \nclinician survey. Over 82% believed diet plays a role in IBD pathogenesis, \nsymptoms, complications, microbiota, and treatment response. This was a shift \nfrom the index study, where the role of diet in pathogenesis was more debated \n(31%). Most clinicians (78%) thought exclusive enteral nutrition and the Crohn's \nDisease Exclusion Diet were effective, with most (87%) non-dietitian clinicians \nreferring to dietitians for these therapies. Despite this, 57% of clinicians \nfelt their views differed from their patients'-similar rates to previous. While \n94% of clinicians reported providing dietary education, only 18% of patients \nreported receiving such advice from their specialist-a gap similar to that in \nthe index study (98% and 26%, respectively).\nCONCLUSION: Although patients and clinicians are increasingly recognising the \nrole of diet in IBD, a persistent communication gap may contribute to \nheterogeneous and poorly followed dietary advice.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The British Dietetic Association Ltd.\n\nDOI: 10.1111/jhn.70098\nPMID: 40676893 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n28.

This meta-analysis evaluates survival outcomes in patients \nwith advanced or metastatic ovarian, colorectal, and gastric cancers treated \nwith CRS and multimodal therapies (e.g., HIPEC, extensive intraoperative \nperitoneal lavage (EIPL), systemic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted \ntherapy) versus CRS alone or with control-based regimens, focusing on the \napplicability of these treatments to these specific cancers.\nMETHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane \nLibrary, and the abstracts of the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) \nand American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) congresses up to April 21, \n2025, for randomized trials published in English. The primary outcomes were \noverall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS); secondary outcomes \nincluded mortality, adverse events, and 3- and 5-year OS rates. Hazard ratios \n(HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using fixed- or \nrandom-effects models, depending on heterogeneity (I\u00b2).\nFINDINGS: From 16,064 records, 13 studies (n\u2009=\u20093,925 patients, control \ngroup\u2009=\u20091,894, experimental group\u2009=\u20092,031) met inclusion criteria. The \nexperimental group significantly improved OS (HR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.77 - 0.95, \nP\u2009=\u20090.003, I\u00b2\u2009=\u200922%, P\u2009=\u20090.26) and PFS (HR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.50 - 0.90, \nP\u2009=\u20090.009, I\u00b2\u2009=\u200983%, P\u2009<\u20090.001) compared to the control group. Subgroup analyses \nhighlighted heterogeneity in PFS benefits, with recent trials (published in or \nafter 2023) showing more potent effects (HR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.44 - 0.64, P < \n0.001). Mortality reduction favored the experimental group (risk ratio (RR): \n0.86, 95% CI: 0.75 - 0.99, P\u2009=\u20090.03, I\u00b2\u2009=\u200926%, P\u2009=\u20090.24), though clinical \nrelevance requires cautious interpretation. The experimental group significantly \nincreased grade 3 or worse adverse events (RR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.16 - 1.48, \nP\u2009<\u20090.001, I\u00b2\u2009=\u200931%, P\u2009=\u20090.04), with significant effects driven by digestive \nsystem (RR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.06 - 1.93) and circulatory system (RR: 1.58, 95% CI: \n1.07 - 2.32) events.\nINTERPRETATION: CRS combined with multimodal therapies, confers significant \nsurvival benefits in advanced ovarian, colorectal, and gastric cancers despite \nelevated complication risks. These findings support the tailored integration of \nmultimodal strategies in selected patients, highlighting the need for robust \nrandomized trials to validate long-term efficacy and safety.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

The \nhistological features were identified and constructed using LASSO (Least \nabsolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression to develop the \nradiation-induced colorectal injury (RCI) score. An AF prediction mode based on \nthe RCI score was built and evaluated using the area under the receiver \noperating characteristic curve (AUC), decision curve analysis (DCA), and the \nDeLong test.\nRESULTS: The primary cohort consisted of 245 patients, among whom AF occurred in \n26.9% of cases, while the validation cohort comprised 105 patients, with an AF \nrate of 24.8%. The RCI score of anastomotic margins showed a significant \ncorrelation with AF (odds ratio: 2.963; 95% confidence interval [CI]: \n2.298-3.822; P\u2009<\u20090.001). Multivariable analysis identified body mass index \n(BMI)\u2009<\u200918.5, tumor location, long-course radiotherapy, and the RCI score as \nindependent predictors for AF. The nomogram based on the RCI score exhibited \ngood discrimination in both the primary cohort (AUC: 0.886; 95% CI: \n0.840-0.931), with a sensitivity of 86.36% (95% CI, 75.7-93.6%) and specificity \nof 76.54% (95% CI, 69.6-82.5%). Calibration curves revealed satisfactory \nagreement between the predicted and the observed probabilities.\nCONCLUSIONS: The comprehensive nomogram incorporating the RCI score could assist \nphysicians in predicting AF and formulating personalized treatment strategies \nfor RC patients with neoadjuvant radiotherapy.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Genetic testing revealed a pathogenic mutation in the \nserine/threonine protein kinase 11 (STK11) gene c.843del frameshift variant \n(p.L282Sfs*5), characterized by guanine deletion at position 843 resulting in \nleucine-to-serine substitution at residue 282, complete alteration of downstream \namino acid sequence, and premature translation termination. In addition, she \nalso presented with MCDK.\nCONCLUSION: This case reveals a potential novel role of STK11 in renal \nembryogenesis, expanding its phenotypic spectrum and challenging the \nconventional paradigm that STK11 mutations solely confer tumor predisposition. \nThrough comprehensive literature review, we propose three mechanistic hypotheses \n- \"metabolo-developmental coupling disruption\", \"ciliopathy-like pathogenesis\", \nand \"epigenetic modulation of developmental plasticity\" - providing new \nmolecular insights into congenital renal anomalies. These findings warrant \nsystematic renal evaluation in PJS patients and exploration of \nmetabolism-targeted therapeutic strategies.\nCLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Primary outcomes were \npostoperative pain scores using the visual analogue scale at multiple time \npoints within the first 48\u00a0h. Secondary outcomes included tramadol consumption, \nincidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, and quality of recovery-15 \n(QoR-15) scores.\nRESULTS: The trial ultimately involved 71 patients. Results showed that the PNB \ngroup had significantly lower pain scores at 6, 12, and 18\u00a0h postoperatively \ncompared with the LAI group (all P\u2009<\u20090.01), with no significant differences \nnoted at 24 and 48\u00a0h. PNB group also had fewer patients requiring supplemental \ntramadol (5/36) than the LAI group (12/35) (P\u2009<\u20090.05) and experienced a delayed \nonset of pain (13.83\u2009\u00b1\u200911.21\u00a0h vs. 6.94\u2009\u00b1\u20092.88\u00a0h; P\u2009<\u20090.001). Furthermore, the \nincidence of anal sphincter spasms was lower in the PNB group (5/36) compared \nwith the LAI group (12/35) (P\u2009<\u20090.04). QoR-15 scores at 24\u00a0h postoperatively \nwere significantly higher in the PNB group (119.11\u2009\u00b1\u20095.87) compared with the LAI \ngroup (112.03\u2009\u00b1\u20097.04) (P\u2009<\u20090.05), indicating a better early recovery experience. \nPatient satisfaction was higher in the PNB group (28/36 vs. 22/35, P\u2009<\u20090.05).\nCONCLUSION: Ultrasound-guided PNB was more effective than LAI in pain control \nand recovery quality. It can be considered an effective method for postoperative \npain management in patients undergoing PPH surgery.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial \nRegistry ( https://www.chictr.org.cn/ , Registration No. ChiCTR-IPR-15006427) on \nMay 21st, 2015.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

The Czech Republic is a region with a natural occurrence of \ngenotype 3 HEV (HEV-3). The disease caused by this genotype has specific \ncharacteristics. The predominant route of transmission is zoonotic, through \nundercooked meat or offal from reservoir animals. Most infections are \nasymptomatic. Symptomatic hepatitis E may present as acute hepatitis with \nnon-specific symptoms of viral infection and elevated serum aminotransferase \nactivity, or it may lead to liver failure and death. Additionally, numerous \nextrahepatic manifestations and the potential for chronic hepatitis development \nin immunocompromised patients have been described. The article provides a \ncomprehensive summary of current recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment \nof hepatitis E virus infections in the context of the Czech Republic.\n\nPMID: 40678883 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n33.

While TDF is recognized for its \nlipid-lowering properties, the long-term effects of TMF on lipid metabolism \nremain unclear.\nAIM: To assess lipid changes and long-term safety of TMF in CHB, including \noutcomes after TDF-to-TMF switch over 144 weeks.\nMETHODS: This retrospective analysis utilized data from a phase III randomized, \ndouble-blind trial involving 53 patients with CHB treated with either TMF 25 mg \n(n = 39) or TDF 300 mg (n = 14) once daily for 96 weeks. Following this blinded \nphase, all participants entered an open-label extension in which they received \nTMF until week 144. This design enabled assessment of both the comparative \neffects of TMF and TDF and the impact of switching from TDF to TMF, thereby \nreflecting real-world treatment scenarios. Virological, biochemical and imaging \nevaluations were performed throughout the study.\nRESULTS: At week 96, both groups achieved comparable virological suppression and \nmaintained stable hepatic and renal function. However, total cholesterol and \nlow-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly higher in the TMF \ngroup compared to the TDF group (P = 0.012 and P = 0.040, respectively). TDF was \nassociated with a transient increase in serum phosphate (P = 0.030). After \nswitching to TMF, lipid profiles in the former TDF group gradually aligned with \nthose of the continuous TMF group by week 144, with no lipid abnormalities \nobserved in either group.\nCONCLUSION: TMF provides sustained antiviral efficacy and maintains a favourable \nlong-term lipid and renal safety profile. These findings support TMF as a viable \nfirst-line therapy and a switch option for CHB management in clinical practice.\n\n\u00a9The Author(s) 2025. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

The current clinical \nmanagement of MASLD largely involves generalized lifestyle modifications \nincluding diet and broad-spectrum metabolic interventions such as insulin \nsensitizers. These approaches often yield suboptimal outcomes because of poor \nlong-term adherence, heterogeneous patient responses, and limited efficacy in \nadvanced disease stages. Crucially, they fail to address disease-specific \nmolecular drivers, such as aging-associated pathways exemplified by vitamin D \nreceptor dysregulation.

Autophagy plays a pivotal role in the immune response and \nfunctions as a lysosome-mediated degradation mechanism essential for recycling \ncellular components and eliminating aggregated proteins, damaged organelles, and \ninvasive pathogens, thereby maintaining cellular function and dynamic \nhomeostasis. Additionally, autophagy regulates several critical proteins and \nsignaling pathways, including mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR), \nBeclin-1, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mTOR signaling \npathway, the Hippo/yes-associated protein signaling pathway, and the Janus \nkinase/signal transducer of activation signaling pathway. This regulatory \ncapacity of autophagy can potentially prevent or delay the progression of HCC. \nNowadays, many studies have shown that different types of herbal monomers such \nas the more common quercetin, baicalein, berberine and emodin can further \nregulate autophagy and exert preventive and therapeutic effects on HCC through \nthe modulation of mTOR and other related signaling pathways and so on. In this \npaper, we examine the mechanisms of autophagy, key proteins and signaling \npathways involved, and the modulation of autophagy by Chinese medicine monomers \nin the prevention and treatment of HCC. This review aims to provide valuable \ninsights for the development of Chinese medicine strategies against HCC and to \ninform the rational use of these therapies in clinical practice.\n\n\u00a9The Author(s) 2025.

This study aimed to evaluate \nthe potential of serum growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) as a biomarker \nfor predicting therapeutic response and survival outcomes in HCC patients \nundergoing FOLFOX-HAIC.\nMETHODS: Pretreatment serum samples were collected from patients with \nunresectable HCC who received FOLFOX-HAIC between October 2016 and January 2019. \nGDF15 levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). \nAssociations between serum GDF15 levels and treatment response, overall survival \n(OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and clinical characteristics were \nanalyzed.\nRESULTS: A total of 150 patients were included in the study. The mean GDF15 \nlevel was 7.16 ng/mL (mean \u00b1 SEM: 7.16 \u00b1 0.72; range: 0.39-53.55 ng/mL). High \nserum GDF15 levels were significantly associated with poorer treatment response, \nshorter OS (median: 21.1 vs 40.33 months, p = 0.0081) and PFS (median: 13.93 vs \n20.47 months, p = 0.0125). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis \nidentified serum GDF15 as an independent predictor of PFS (HR, 1.521; 95% CI, \n1.014-2.283; p = 0.043). Additionally, elevated GDF15 was positively correlated \nwith larger tumor size (p < 0.0001), presence of microvascular invasion (p = \n0.026) and abnormal AST levels (p = 0.001).\nCONCLUSION: Serum GDF15 represents a potential prognostic biomarker in patients \nwith unresectable HCC undergoing FOLFOX-HAIC treatment and may help guide \ntreatment stratification.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Xing, Gan, Mei, Li and Xu.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1619387\nPMCID: PMC12267266\nPMID: 40677718 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n37.

While the \nTriggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 1 (TREM1) is well-known for its \nrole in amplifying inflammation within the tumor microenvironment (TME), its \ntumor-intrinsic role remains poorly defined. Liver cancer stem-like cells \n(LCSLCs), charecerized by expression of CD133 and EpCAM, are critical for HCC \ninitiation, metastasis, recurrence, and therapy resistance.\nMETHODS: We used flow cytometry to assess TREM1 expression in LCSLCs and \nemployed CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to knock out TREM1 in HCC cell lines. \nFunctional assays, including proliferation, migration, apoptosis, clonogenicity, \nand spheroid formation, were performed. Cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) models \nwere used to evaluate in vivo tumorigenicity. Transcriptomic profiling was \nconducted to explore downstream effects of TREM1 deletion. Additionally, a \npharmacological inhibitor of TREM1 (VJDT) was used to validate the therapeutic \npotential of targeting TREM1 in vivo.\nRESULTS: TREM1 was highly expressed in CD133+EpCAM+ LCSLCs. Knockout of TREM1 \nsignificantly impaired proliferation and migration while promoting apoptosis in \nHCC cells. In LCSLCs, TREM1 silencing reduced clonogenic ability and spheroid \nformation, indicating loss of self-renewal and stemness. In CDX models, \nTREM1-deficient LCSLCs exhibited markedly reduced tumorigenicity. Transcriptomic \nanalysis revealed distinct, context-dependent gene expression changes in nuclear \nand extracellular signaling pathways following TREM1 loss. Pharmacologic \ninhibition of TREM1 with VJDT recapitulated the tumor-suppressive effects \nobserved in genetic models.\nDISCUSSION: Our findings establish TREM1 as a critical tumor-intrinsic regulator \nof LCSLC survival and tumorigenic potential, independent of its known \nimmunomodulatory role in the TME. Targeting TREM1 may therefore represent a \npromising dual-action therapeutic strategy to disrupt both cancer stem-like cell \nfunction and the pro-inflammatory tumor milieu in HCC.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Sreekumar, Ajith, Mamouni, Horuzsko and Horuzsko.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1618342\nPMCID: PMC12267286\nPMID: 40677705 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: AA and AH are inventors on a patent application \n(US patent no.US21/51072) submitted by Augusta University that covers \ncompositions and methods for inhibiting TREM1.

Nearly half of CRC patients develop \nmetastatic disease, with the liver being the most frequent site of metastases. \nWhile curative-intent surgical resection remains the gold standard for \ncolorectal liver metastases (CRLM), most patients are initially ineligible for \nsurgery, and recurrence rates remain high. Systemic chemotherapy is the primary \ntreatment for unresectable CRLM, with some patients achieving downstaging to \nsurgical eligibility. Alternative approaches, including immune checkpoint \ninhibitors for MSI-H/dMMR cancers, hepatic artery infusion pumps, and \nlocoregional therapies, have been explored to improve survival. Liver \ntransplantation (LT) was initially abandoned for CRLM due to poor outcomes, but \nadvancements in surgical techniques, immunosuppression, and donor availability \nhave reignited interest in this approach.

There \nhave been rare reports of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with IPH, \nbut no causal relationship has been confirmed. This report details the case of \nan 88-year-old Japanese woman who developed HCC after a 30-year history of IPH \nand was treated with carbon-ion radiotherapy. CASE REPORT An 88-year-old \nJapanese woman had presented to our hospital 33 years earlier with bleeding from \nesophageal varices. Liver function test results were normal. Computed tomography \n(CT) showed marked splenomegaly. She had no known causative factors for liver \ndisease, and IPH was suspected. Endoscopic injection sclerotherapy was performed \nrepeatedly for episodes of bleeding from esophageal varices until 4 years after \npresentation, when she underwent Hassab's procedure. A liver biopsy showed \npreserved lobular architecture and moderate fibrous enlargement of the portal \narea without necro-inflammatory reaction. She had a stroke 18 years later and \nwas started on clopidogrel. Nine years later, CT revealed a 24-mm HCC in S8, and \nportal vein thrombosis (PVT). Carbon-ion radiotherapy was administered, followed \nby edoxaban. Three months later, CT showed shrinkage of the HCC and complete \nresolution of the PVT. Almost 3 years later, CT showed no recurrence of HCC or \nPVT. CONCLUSIONS We report a rare case of IPH and HCC co-existing in a patient \nfollowed up for more than 30 years. Although there is no recognized association \nbetween IPH and HCC, this report highlights the importance of continued clinical \nfollow-up of patients with chronic liver disease.\n\nDOI: 10.12659/AJCR.947725\nPMID: 40676829 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n40.

This study analyzed mortality \ntrends and regional/urban-rural disparities of these three diseases among \nChinese elderly individuals aged 60\u00a0years and older from 2004 to 2021 to \nidentify priority areas for targeted prevention strategies.\nMETHODS: Data were sourced from the \"China Cause-of-Death Surveillance Dataset \n(2004-2021)\" published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. \nThe study population comprised Chinese elderly individuals aged 60\u00a0years and \nolder from 2004 to 2021. Joinpoint 4.9.0.1 software was used for joinpoint \nregression analysis to characterize dynamic mortality trends, calculating \naverage annual percentage change (AAPC), annual percentage change (APC), and 95% \nconfidence intervals (CIs).\nRESULTS: From 2004 to 2021, 100,934 deaths from the three chronic infectious \ndiseases occurred among Chinese elderly. The overall age-standardized mortality \nrate (ASMR) decreased from 51.00 to 13.37 per 100,000 (AAPC: -\u00a07.54%, 95% CI: \n-\u00a09.38%, -\u00a05.67%). Notably, the ASMR for HIV/AIDS increased from 0.11 to 0.85 \nper 100,000 population, while the ASMR for hepatitis B declined from 17.96 to \n6.84 per 100,000 population and TB declined from 32.92 to 5.68 per 100,000 \npopulation. The three chronic infectious diseases collectively demonstrated the \nmost significant ASMR reduction in central China (AAPC: -\u00a07.85%, 95% CI: \n-\u00a012.11%, -\u00a03.39%), followed by eastern China (-\u00a07.57%, 95% CI: -\u00a09.02%, \n-\u00a06.09%) and western China (-\u00a07.10%, 95% CI: -\u00a09.52%, -\u00a04.62%). Rural areas \nexperienced substantially steeper ASMR declines compared to urban areas (AAPC: \n-\u00a07.81%, 95% CI: -\u00a09.40%, -\u00a06.18% vs. AAPC: -\u00a06.05%, 95% CI: -\u00a08.20%, -\u00a03.85%).\nCONCLUSION: China achieved a continuous decline in the overall ASMR for the \nthree chronic infectious diseases among elderly populations during 2004-2021, \nsuggesting initial success in prevention efforts. However, the rising ASMR for \nHIV/AIDS necessitates disease-specific strategies. Notable regional disparities \npersist:\u00a0hepatitis B and TB remain concentrated in western/rural areas, while \nthe ASMR for HIV/AIDS is higher in urban regions. Future efforts should tailor \nresource allocation to local contexts to enhance intervention outcomes and \nprotect elderly health.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

All patients were taking UDCA capsules orally \nfor one year and were randomly divided into two groups: UDCA\u2009+\u2009VitD group, which \nreceived UDCA combined with VitD (1200 IU/day) treatment, and the UDCA \nmonotherapy group. After one year of treatment, the UDCA monotherapy group was \nthen further stratified into two subgroups using the same\u00a0method, and treatment \nwas extended for an additional year, to further verify the role of VitD in the \ntreatment of PBC with UDCA. Clinical manifestations, blood tests, and imaging \ntests were collected before and after treatment. The efficacy was evaluated \nusing the Paris I and Barcelona standards, and the improvement of liver \nstiffness value was assessed according to the liver stiffness measurement (LSM) \nusing FibroTouch.\nRESULTS: After one year of treatment, the UDCA\u2009+\u2009VitD group showed statistically \nsignificant decreases in AST, GGT, ALP, Tbil, PT, INR, IgM and LSM levels, and \nincreases in ALB and 25(OH)D levels compared to the UDCA monotherapy group. The \n25(OH)D levels had a negative correlation with LSM levels. Additionally, 80.0% \nof patients in the UDCA\u2009+\u2009VitD group responded according to the Paris I \ncriteria, while 86.7% responded according to the Barcelona criteria, 50.0% of \npatients in the UDCA monotherapy group responded according to the Paris I \ncriteria and 63.3% responded according to the Barcelona criteria. The response \nrate in the UDCA\u2009+\u2009VitD group was higher than that in the UDCA monotherapy group \nunder both criteria. In the second year of the study after the second \nrandomization, 86.7% of patients responded according to the Paris I criteria in \nthe UDCA\u2009+\u2009VitD subgroup, while 93.3% responded according to the Barcelona \ncriteria. 53.3% of patients in the UDCA monotherapy subgroup responded according \nto the Paris I criteria and 66.7% according to the Barcelona criteria. The \nUDCA\u2009+\u2009VitD subgroup had a higher Paris I response rate compared with the UDCA \nmonotherapy subgroup.\nCONCLUSIONS: The combination of UDCA and VitD can increase the drug response \nrate of UDCA and improve liver function and hepatic fibrosis in PBC patients. \nVitD may plays an important role in the treatment of PBC.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

In diabetic patients with \nmetabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), widely used non-invasive \nscoring systems, particularly the fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score, showed \nunsatisfactory performance in predicting liver fibrosis severity. The aim of \nthis study was to evaluate the productivity of serum PDGFR\u03b2 as a non-invasive \nbiomarker of liver fibrosis in diabetic MAFLD patients.\nMETHODS: This was a population-based case-control study conducted on 50 diabetic \nMAFLD patients, 40 nondiabetic MAFLD patients, and 40 healthy controls. All \nsubjects underwent complete history taking, clinical examination, anthropometric \nmeasurements, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and laboratory tests, \nincluding the PDGFR\u03b2 assay. Hepatic steatosis was assessed with magnetic \nresonance imaging (MRI), along with magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) for \nthe assessment of liver fibrosis. The diagnostic performance of PDGFR\u03b2 as well \nas PDGFR\u03b2\u2009+\u2009FIB-4 in prediction of significant liver fibrosis in diabetic MAFLD \npatients was assessed.\nRESULTS: Liver steatosis and significant liver fibrosis (\u2265\u2009F2) were \nsignificantly higher in diabetic MAFLD patients than in nondiabetics. PDGFR\u03b2 \nlevels were significantly higher in both diabetic and nondiabetic MAFLD patients \ncompared to controls. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), \nand negative predictive value (NPV) of PDGFR\u03b2 to predict significant liver \nfibrosis in diabetic MAFLD patients were 85%, 93.33%, 89.5%, and 90.3%, \nrespectively, at a cutoff\u2009>\u20092.54, and were 85.71%, 51.52%, 27.3%, and 94.4% at a \ncutoff\u2009>\u20091.59 in nondiabetics. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of (PDGFR\u03b2 \nat a cutoff\u2009>\u20092.54\u2009+\u2009FIB-4 at a cutoff\u2009>\u20091.17) to predict significant liver \nfibrosis in diabetic MAFLD patients were 100%. PDGFR\u03b2 was the only independent \npredictor of significant liver fibrosis in diabetic MAFLD (p\u2009=\u20090.006).\nCONCLUSIONS: PDGFR\u03b2 proved efficacy as a noninvasive biomarker in the prediction \nof significant liver fibrosis (\u2265\u2009F2) in diabetic MAFLD patients.\n\n\u00a9 2024.

Regardless of the outcome, anti-HCV antibodies \nwill be present in the individual bloodstream who have had contact with the \nvirus, which is why the sensitivity of these antibodies is high in monitoring \nthe infection, except in specific cases. For this reason, epidemiological \nsurveillance of hepatitis C is based on tracking this marker, both in the \ngeneral population and in the high-risk groups.On the other hand, since it is \nthe only marker of infection addressed in hepatitis C surveillance, the \ndetection of anti-HCV antibodies in the bloodstream does not have sufficient \nspecificity to indicate the infection's clinical classification. On the \ncontrary, their detection can have three very distinct meanings: Active \ninfection (acute or chronic), defined by the detection of these antibodies and \nHCV RNA in the serum; Past (resolved) following previous exposure, when HCV RNA \nis not detectable in the serum, or false-positive result, when the anti-HCV \nantibodies detection is not confirmed. This manuscript discusses the specificity \nof anti-HCV antibodies in the clinical classification of HCV infection and their \nsensitivity in the epidemiological surveillance of hepatitis C. This review \ncovers the clinical and epidemiological interpretations of the marker itself, \nwithout reference to any specific assays.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

In this study, 53 immune-related key \ngenes involved in HBV-associated HCC progression were identified. By analyzing \nthe mean C-index of 101 machine learning models, the optimal model-combining \nstepwise Cox regression (forward) with RSF-was developed to characterize the \nimmune risk index. Patients in the high-risk group exhibited worse survival \noutcomes and increased infiltration of immunosuppressive cells. Integrating PPI \nanalysis with machine learning, SPP1, GHR, and ESR1 emerged as promising \ndruggable targets, with SPP1 notably overexpressed in tumors and linked to \nadverse outcomes. ScRNA-seq analysis revealed SPP1 was predominantly expressed \nin angio-TAMs, which may impair anti-tumor immunity by limiting T and NK cell \ninfiltration. It also involved in tumor progression via angiogenesis and EMT \npathways. Drug prediction and molecular docking identified small molecules such \nas myricetin and mefloquine that can target the aforementioned key immune genes, \nthereby modulating the immune landscape of HBV-HCC. Repurposing these \nestablished drugs represents a novel therapeutic avenue, offering both efficacy \nand expedited clinical translation for HBV-HCC.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

However, few studies \nreported differences in perinatal outcomes of monochorionic(MC) and \ndichorionic(DC) twin pregnancies complicated by ICP. These perinatal outcomes \nwere assessed with a retrospective cohort study. This was a retrospective \nobservational study of MC and DC twin pregnancies complicated by ICP. Cases were \ndivided into the MC group and DC group, perinatal outcomes were compared, and \npredictors of adverse perinatal outcomes were evaluated. In total, 363 twin \npregnancies complicated by ICP (93 MC, 270 DC) were included. Compared with DC \ntwin pregnancies, MC pregnancies were characterized by younger age, lower \npre-pregnancy weight and lower pre-pregnancy body mass index (p\u2009<\u20090.05). \nDelivery of MC twins was more likely to occur between 34 and 37\u00a0weeks, averaging \n34.87\u2009\u00b1\u20092.42 gestational weeks. Additionally, both twins A and B in the MC group \nweighed less than those in the DC group (p\u2009<\u20090.001). After adjustment for \nconfounders, GA at diagnosis\u2009<\u200932\u00a0weeks (aOR\u2009=\u20091.096, 95% CI 1.031-2.393, \np\u2009=\u20090.000) was an independent risk factor in MC twin pregnancies, while GA at \ndiagnosis\u2009<\u200932\u00a0weeks(aOR\u2009=\u200913.626, 95% CI 1.783-14.177, p\u2009=\u20090.012) and AST\u2009>\u2009200 \nU/L (aOR\u2009=\u20093.178, 95% CI 1.252-8.068, p\u2009=\u20090.015) were independent risk factors \nfor adverse perinatal outcomes in DC twin pregnancies. Our results indicated \nthat some liver function biochemical indicators could predict poor foetal \noutcomes in twin pregnancies complicated by ICP. Greater emphasis should be \nplacedon monitoring of predelivery liver functional biochemical indexes in \npregnant women according to chorionicity complicated by ICP, to facilitate \npersonalized antenatal management and improve neonatal outcomes.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Then, \nwe develop a prognostic model incorporating 9 of these genes through LASSO-Cox \nregression analysis, and confirm the model's independent prognostic significance \nfor overall survival in HCC patients by using multivariable Cox proportional \nhazards analysis. Furthermore, we observe significant enrichment of activated \nproliferation-related pathways, increased infiltration of immunosuppressive \ncells and resistance to anti-PD-L1 therapy in the high-risk group defined by \nthis model. These findings suggest that the ARG model may serve as a novel \nprognostic indicator for HCC patients and underscore the critical role of \nanoikis in HCC progression.\n\nPublisher: \u62b5\u6297\u5931\u5de2\u51cb\u4ea1(anoikis)\u8fdb\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u764c\u7ec6\u80de\u5b58\u6d3b\u662f\u8bb8\u591a\u764c\u75c7\u53d1\u751f\u3001\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u809d\u7ec6\u80de\u764c(hepatocellular \ncarcinoma\uff0cHCC)\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u590d\u53d1\u7387\u9ad8\u3001\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u6076\u6027\u80bf\u7624\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5931\u5de2\u51cb\u4ea1\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u4ecd\u7136\u8f83\u5c11\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5931\u5de2\u51cb\u4ea1\u76f8\u5173\u57fa\u56e0(anoikis-related \ngene\uff0cARG)\u9884\u6d4bHCC\u7684\u9884\u540e\u53ca\u514d\u75ab\u5fae\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u53ef\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5931\u5de2\u51cb\u4ea1\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8e\u764c\u75c7\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u56fe\u8c31(The Cancer Genome \nAtlas\uff0cTCGA)HCC\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9274\u5b9a\u51fa74\u4e2a\u5728\u809d\u764c\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u8868\u8fbe\u7684ARG\u3002\u901a\u8fc7LASSO-Cox\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u5176\u4e2d9\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u57fa\u56e0\u7684HCC\u9884\u540e\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u591a\u56e0\u7d20Cox\u6bd4\u4f8b\u98ce\u9669\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u60a3\u8005\u603b\u4f53\u751f\u5b58\u7387\uff0c\u662fHCC\u65b0\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u9884\u540e\u6307\u6807\u3002\u57fa\u4e8eARG\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u98ce\u9669\u7ec4\u5728\u901a\u8def\u6d3b\u6027\u3001\u514d\u75ab\u7ec6\u80de\u6d78\u6da6\u548cHCC\u60a3\u8005\u751f\u5b58\u72b6\u6001\u7b49\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u4e0e\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u7ec4\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7ec6\u80de\u589e\u6b96\u76f8\u5173\u901a\u8def\u663e\u8457\u6d3b\u5316\uff0c\u514d\u75ab\u6291\u5236\u6027\u7ec6\u80de\u7684\u6d78\u6da6\u6bd4\u4f8b\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u809d\u764c\u60a3\u8005\u5bf9PD-L1\u5355\u6297\u6cbb\u7597\u8010\u836f\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u4e0a\u8ff0\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5efa\u7acb\u7684ARG\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6307\u6807\u53ef\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4bHCC\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u9884\u540e\uff0c\u5e76\u521d\u6b65\u63ed\u793a\u4e86ARG\u5728\u809d\u764c\u8fdb\u5c55\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002.\n\nDOI: 10.16288/j.yczz.25-007\nPMID: 40675763 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n47.

The objective of this study is to show how navigation \nsystems can increase safety and precision in the ablative treatment of lesions \nin the hepatic dome.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective single-centre study was carried out from \nApril 2018 to February 2022. Percutaneous ablation procedures were performed \nwith CT-navigation system assistance on 75 patients, of which 18 had lesions in \nthe hepatic dome (16 HCCs and 5 metastatic tumours). Syngo.via VB30 software was \nused to analyse the volume of lesions and ablation areas in pre- and \npost-treatment CT images. Technical success was determined 24\u00a0h following the \nprocedure and according to the length of time free from tumour viability \n(through imaging tests every three months).\nRESULTS: A volumetric study was carried out for 20 of the 21 lesions (95%) and \ntechnical success was achieved in 11 of the 21 lesions (52%). In 9 of the 12 \nlesions that completed a year of follow-up (75%), no signs of tumour viability \nwere detected, achieving local control of the disease. Furthermore, in five of \nthese nine lesions (56%) no progression was observed in other locations of the \nliver. The syngo.via software version VB30 was able to predict the area of \nrecurrence in 71% of cases. No permanent side effects or death were secondary to \nthe procedure.\nCONCLUSION: CT navigation systems provide increased safety and precision in the \npercutaneous ablative treatment of tumours in the hepatic dome, making this \ntechnique a good treatment option.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 SERAM.
