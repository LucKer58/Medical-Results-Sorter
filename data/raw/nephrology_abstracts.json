A survey of 89 Italian nephrologists \nrevealed heterogeneous biomarker availability and varied treatment approaches. \nDenosumab was the preferred antiresorptive agent, while anabolic drugs were \nrarely used. Findings highlight progress in CKD-related bone health management \ndespite existing uncertainties. CKD-associated osteoporosis comprises the \nskeletal effects of a complex mineral and bone disorder causing increased risks \nof fragility fractures (FF), cardiovascular events, and mortality. Existing \nclinical guidance about CKD-associated osteoporosis is vague, leading us to \nhypothesize that a treatment gap exists and that clinical practice is dependent \non local availability of diagnostic tools.\nPURPOSE AND METHODS: The aim of the current survey was to determine current \nattitudes and practices among Italian nephrologists regarding the evaluation and \nmanagement of CKD-associated osteoporosis. An online survey was designed, \nconsisting of 9 thematic groups with a set of 16 closed questions regarding the \navailability of biomarkers and BTMs at reference laboratories and their use for \nthe diagnosis and treatment of CKD-associated osteoporosis in patients with \ndifferent stages of CKD, including CKD stages G4-5 and dialysis patients. \nResults were compared to a previous survey on the use of BTMs from 2022.\nRESULTS: Eighty-nine Italian nephrologists participated in the survey, reporting \nthat parathyroid hormone (PTH), alkaline phosphatase, and 25-hydroxy-vitamin D \nmeasurements were available in 92-100% of their reference laboratories. \nMeasurements for fibroblast growth factor-23, Klotho, Matrix Gla protein, \nprocollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide, and tartrate-resistant acid \nphosphatase 5b were available in 64-74% of cases. Regarding PTH cut-off values, \n47.2% followed KDOQI and 43.8% followed KDIGO recommendations. Vitamin D was \nwidely used across CKD stages (cholecalciferol 27-37.1%, calcifediol 9-12.4%, \ncalcitriol 47.2-53.9%, and paricalcitol 21.3-30.3). Denosumab was the preferred \nantiresorptive agent in all CKD stages (22.5%-28.1%), while the use of \nbisphosphonates was uncommon in advanced CKD. Anabolic drugs were rarely \nprescribed.\nCONCLUSIONS: The availability of bone biomarkers is heterogeneous, and an \nuncertainty still exists regarding the clinical use of biomarkers in \nCKD-associated osteoporosis. Nonetheless, our findings indicate that Italian \nnephrologists are increasingly taking proactive steps to prevent and treat bone \nfragility in CKD patients.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

This study explores the integration of Problem-Based Learning \n(PBL) guided by ChatGPT in the Department of Nephrology at Guizhou Provincial \nPeople's Hospital to enhance medical education.\nOBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of ChatGPT-guided Problem-Based Learning (PBL) \non medical students' education and satisfaction in the Nephrology Department.\nMETHODS: Fifty-four clinical resident doctors were divided into an experimental \ngroup, using ChatGPT-guided PBL, and a control group, using traditional methods. \nBoth groups were assessed through theoretical and clinical practice exams, \nteaching satisfaction surveys, and self-assessments of teaching effectiveness.\nRESULTS: Results indicated the experimental group achieved significantly higher \nscores in both theoretical and clinical assessments. Additionally, they reported \nhigher satisfaction and effectiveness in learning. Despite spending more time in \npre-class preparation, the overall learning time did not increase due to reduced \npost-class review time facilitated by ChatGPT.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the potential of ChatGPT-integrated PBL to \nenhance learning outcomes, satisfaction, and efficiency in medical education. \nFuture research should include larger samples and longer follow-up to validate \nthese findings.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Over a 40-year period, the Graduate Program in Nephrology at \nUnifesp has qualified 261 master's graduates, 111 doctors and 146 individuals \nwho completed both a master's and a doctoral degree. Of these, 278 hold a degree \nin Medicine. Medical postgraduates were responsible for 124 master's \ndissertations and 243 doctoral theses completed.\nOBJECTIVE: This study analyzed the profile and professional trajectories of \ngraduate students from the Nephrology Graduate Program at Unifesp.\nMETHODS: The authors used the university's database to establish the graduates' \nprofile and applied a questionnaire to identify their professional performance \nin academia and the job market. The graduates were divided into three groups: G1 \n- 1976 to 1997 (N = 127); G2 - 1998 to 2006 (N = 150); G3 - 2007 to 2015 (N = \n241).\nRESULTS: Regarding sex, male medical graduates were responsible for 53.6% of all \ncompletion papers; however, in the most recent period, women accounted for 61% \nof the works. Female participation was consistently higher among graduates from \nother areas, at 73.8% of the total. Among the physicians, 65.5% graduated from \npublic universities, with the first group standing out with 73%. In the other \ngroups, 59.5% and 59.8% came from public HEIs, respectively. The overall average \nincome reported by master's graduates responding to the questionnaire ranged \nfrom 5 to 10 minimum wages (MW), and for doctors, above 10 MW.\nCONCLUSION: Doctoral graduates had a strong presence in academia, predominantly \nwithin the public sector.\n\nINTRODU\u00c7\u00c3O: A p\u00f3s-gradua\u00e7\u00e3o no Brasil experimentou crescimento significativo \ndesde os anos 1990.

Questions with images were answered only by \nChatGPT-4. Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-square test.\nRESULTS: ChatGPT-4 achieved an overall accuracy of 79.80%, while ChatGPT-3.5 \nachieved 56.29%, with a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001). In the \nmain themes, ChatGPT-4 performed better in HABD (79.11% vs. 55.17%), TID (88.23% \nvs. 52.23%), CKD (75.51% vs. 61.95%), and DG (79.31% vs. 55.29%), all with p < \n0.001. ChatGPT-4 presented an accuracy of 81.49% in questions without images and \n54.54% in questions with images, with an accuracy of 60% for electrocardiogram \nanalysis. This study is limited by the small number of image-based questions and \nthe use of outdated examination items, reducing its ability to assess visual \ndiagnostic skills and current clinical relevance. Furthermore, addressing only 4 \nareas of Nephrology may not fully represent the breadth of nephrology practice.\nCONCLUSION: ChatGPT-3.5 was found to have limitations in nephrology reasoning \ncompared to ChatGPT-4, evidencing gaps in knowledge. The study suggests that \nfurther exploration is needed in other nephrology themes to improve the use of \nthese AI tools.\n\nOBJETIVO: Este estudo avaliou o desempenho das vers\u00f5es 4 e 3.5 do ChatGPT na \nresolu\u00e7\u00e3o de quest\u00f5es de Nefrologia presentes em exames de resid\u00eancia m\u00e9dica no \nBrasil.\nM\u00c9TODOS: Foram analisadas 411 quest\u00f5es de m\u00faltipla escolha, com e sem imagens, \norganizadas em quatro temas principais: doen\u00e7a renal cr\u00f4nica (DRC), dist\u00farbios \ndo equil\u00edbrio hidroeletrol\u00edtico e \u00e1cido-base (DHAB), doen\u00e7as tubulointersticiais \n(DTI) e doen\u00e7as glomerulares (DG). As quest\u00f5es com imagens foram respondidas \nsomente pela vers\u00e3o ChatGPT-4. A an\u00e1lise estat\u00edstica foi realizada utilizando o \nteste qui-quadrado.\nRESULTADOS: O ChatGPT-4 alcan\u00e7ou uma precis\u00e3o geral de 79,80%, enquanto o \nChatGPT-3.5 obteve 56,29%, com uma diferen\u00e7a estatisticamente significativa (p < \n0,001). Nos temas principais, o ChatGPT-4 teve desempenho superior em DHAB \n(79,11% vs. 55,17%), DTI (88,23% vs. 52,23%), DRC (75,51% vs. 61,95%) e DG \n(79,31% vs. 55,29%), todos com p < 0,001. O ChatGPT-4 apresentou uma acur\u00e1cia de \n81,49% nas quest\u00f5es sem imagens e de 54,54% em quest\u00f5es com imagens, com uma \nacur\u00e1cia de 60% para an\u00e1lise de eletrocardiogramas.

AI-driven models utilize diverse datasets-including electronic health \nrecords, imaging, and biomarkers-to improve clinical decision-making. \nApplications such as convolutional neural networks for kidney biopsy \ninterpretation, and predictive modeling for renal replacement therapies \nunderscore AI's potential. Nonetheless, challenges including data quality, \nlimited external validation, algorithmic bias, and poor interpretability \nconstrain the clinical reliability of AI/ML models. To address these issues, \nthis article offers a structured framework for nephrologist peer reviewers, \nintegrating the TRIPOD-AI (Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction \nModel for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis-AI Extension) checklist. Key \nevaluation criteria include dataset integrity, feature selection, model \nvalidation, reporting transparency, ethics, and real-world applicability. This \nframework promotes rigorous peer review and enhances the reproducibility, \nclinical relevance, and fairness of AI research in nephrology. Moreover, AI/ML \nstudies must confront biases-data, selection, and algorithmic-that adversely \naffect model performance. Mitigation strategies such as data diversification, \nmulti-center validation, and fairness-aware algorithms are essential. \nOverfitting in AI is driven by small patient cohorts faced with thousands of \ncandidate features; our framework spotlights this imbalance and offers concrete \nremedies. Future directions in AI-driven nephrology include multimodal data \nfusion for improved predictive modeling, deep learning for automated imaging \nanalysis, wearable-based monitoring, and clinical decision support systems \n(CDSS) that integrate comprehensive patient data.

A cross-sectional study based on an ad hoc \nquestionnaire was conducted between March and May 2024 among nurses working in \nnephrology within the National Health Service, with dissemination support from \nthe Society of Nephrology Nurses. The questionnaire was structured into three \nsections: theoretical knowledge, practical competencies, and professional \ndevelopment, and was validated through a pilot phase. Data were analyzed using \nSPSS 27 software. Results. The study involved 296 nurses, 77% of whom were \nemployed in hemodialysis. Only 14% reported having completed specific post-basic \ntraining courses, while 71% expressed interest in further educational \nopportunities. Technical-specialist competencies in hemodialysis were widely \napplied, but significant gaps were identified in pharmacological management (37% \nwith moderate or low competency levels) and nutrition (35% with moderate or low \ncompetency levels). Decision-making and communication skills scored higher, with \n65% of participants perceiving themselves at a high or excellent level in these \nareas. Conclusion. This study represents an important step towards defining a \ncomprehensive professional profile for nephrology nurses in Italy. The findings \nunderscore the need of standardized educational and professional frameworks to \npromote formal recognition of this specialization while enhancing the quality of \ncare through advanced competencies, humanized approaches, and personalized \npatient support.\n\nCopyright by Societ\u00e0 Italiana di Nefrologia SIN, Rome,Italy.\n\nDOI: 10.69097/42-03-2025-09\nPMID: 40607828 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n7.

We aimed to perform a \nmeta-epidemiologic study to describe the representation, sex and gender \nreporting, and sex- and gender-based analyses (SGBA) in high-impact RCTs in \ncritical care nephrology.\nMETHODS: We searched the Web of Science Core Collection for critical care \nnephrology papers from 2000 to 2024. We included trials published in high-impact \njournals in general medicine, pediatrics, critical care, and nephrology. The \nmain outcome was the proportion of female/woman participants enrolled and the \nassociation with trial characteristics, findings, and women authorship. We \nestimated the participation-to-prevalence ratio (PPR) to evaluate the \nrepresentativeness of females within identified RCTs and selected case-mix and \ndisease populations. Sex and gender reporting and SGBA were investigated.\nRESULTS: A total of 117 RCTs, including 106,057 participants, were included. Sex \n(54.7%), gender (26.5%), both (2.6%), or none (16.2%) terminology were used for \nreporting. Male/female (82.1%), men/women (11.1%), both (4.3%), boys/girls \n(0.9%) and none (1.7%) were used as descriptors. Of the 115 RCTs with available \nsex/gender data, the median proportion of female/women participants was 35.4% \n(interquartile range (IQR) 31.2%-40.8%). Pediatric age group and process of care \nas an intervention were independently associated with the proportion of \nfemale/women participants. The median PPR was 0.89 (IQR 0.8-1.06), except in \nmajor surgery, for which PPR was 0.67 (IQR 0.29-0.73). Twelve (10.9%) and 49 \n(41.9%) studies used sex and/or gender as inclusion and exclusion criteria, \nrespectively; 5 (4.3%) studies used sex/gender-stratified randomization; and 35 \n(29.9%) studies performed SGBA. RCTs with pregnancy, lactation, or women of \nchildbearing age as exclusion criteria had a lower enrollment of female/women \nparticipants than RCTs that did not (33.6% vs. 36.8%, P\u2009=\u20090.04). Exclusion \ncriteria of pregnancy, lactation, or childbearing age were considered strongly \njustified, potentially justified, and poorly justified in 36.1%, 14.9%, and \n48.9%, respectively. There were no changes in the representation of \nfemales/women and SGBA across identified RCTs over the search range.\nCONCLUSIONS: Females/women are less frequently represented in critical care \nnephrology RCTs. Significant gaps exist in sex- and gender-specific eligibility \ncriteria, reporting, and analysis.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

This review summarizes the role of complement activation in kidney \ndiseases and current evidence supporting complement-targeted treatments. As the \ncomplement system can be involved in the pathogenesis of different diseases to \nvarying degrees, several research works have been conducted. These research \nefforts aim, firstly, to understand the mechanisms and role of complement \ncascade components in the most prevalent nephrological diseases and, secondly, \nto explore the potential of complement system inhibitors in these conditions and \ntheir possible clinical applications. Clinical trials demonstrate that \ncomplement inhibitors are most effective in conditions with significant \ncomplement involvement, such as C3 glomerulopathy (C3G), atypical hemolytic \nuremic syndrome (aHUS), and immune complex membranoproliferative \nglomerulonephritis (IC-MPGN). These agents show variable benefits in diseases \nwith partial complement activation, including lupus nephritis and \nANCA-associated vasculitis, while their role in disorders like diabetic \nnephropathy and focal-segmental glomerulosclerosis remains limited. Complement \ninhibition offers a targeted strategy to prevent disease progression and improve \noutcomes in selected nephrological disorders.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/ijms26125902\nPMCID: PMC12192755\nPMID: 40565360 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflicts of interest.\n\n\n10.

While healthcare services should be \nprepared for the increased incidence and changes in the distribution of kidney \ndisease, they also substantially contribute to the depletion of natural \nresources and greenhouse gas emissions. Among these services, the dialysis \nsector stands out for its negative environmental impact, due to its high \nconsumption of water, energy, and supplies, in addition to the waste it \ngenerates. Thus, measures that reduce the use of natural resources in dialysis \nprocedures, as well as those aimed at reducing the number of patients dependent \non dialysis, such as initiatives to prevent kidney disease and encourage kidney \ntransplantation, are of paramount importance. In addition to environmental \ngains, internal actions focused on the implementation of sustainable practices \nmay also generate economic returns. In this article, our objective was to inform \nand contribute to the knowledge on sustainable experiences already implemented \nin a Brazilian philanthropic healthcare institution. Among these, we describe \nhow the use of renewable energy, the reuse of reverse osmosis reject water, and \nwaste recycling translate into reduced operating costs and direct support for \nsocially vulnerable patients.\n\nAs mudan\u00e7as clim\u00e1ticas afetam, e continuar\u00e3o a afetar, a sa\u00fade global e renal de \nmilh\u00f5es de pessoas ao redor do mundo.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a POCUS \neducational programme on POCUS implementation in clinical nephrology.\nMETHODS: This single-centre observational study was conducted between 2022 and \n2024 and comprised 162 patients with AKI. We compared POCUS use, including the \nchecking of the inferior vena cava diameter, urinary obstruction, and venous \nexcess ultrasound (VExUS) grading system, before and after lectures and hands-on \ntraining in 2023.\nRESULTS: There was a significant increase in POCUS implementation for AKI \nevaluation, including VExUS for assessing congestion. Post-training, the \nprocedure implementation of VExUS for patients with congestion (N\u2009=\u200929) \nincreased from 0% in 2022 to 66.7% in 2023 and 56.3% in 2024. Severe congestion \nby VExUS might be related to poor outcomes, including higher rates of \nhaemodialysis and mortality. Despite technical difficulties in visualising renal \ninterlobular veins using pulse-wave Doppler in VExUS, the visualisation rate \nimproved over time, increasing from 50% in 2023 to 66.7% in 2024.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results underscore the importance of developing comprehensive \nnephrology-oriented POCUS training programmes, even at the facility level, \ncoupled with on-the-job training to improve clinical use. However, the procedure \nimplementation of VExUS plateaued in years when the lectures were not conducted. \nThus, regularly conducted lectures, the development of supervising physicians' \nteaching skills, and the implementation of a robust training system would be \nnecessary.\n\n\u00a9 2025 Asian Pacific Society of Nephrology.\n\nDOI: 10.1111/nep.70060\nPMID: 40452263 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n13.

Incorporating these agents into \nneoadjuvant/adjuvant treatment regimens for early-stage cancers may provide \nhealth and economic benefits at the population level.\nMETHODS: A health outcomes projection model compared two scenarios in \nSwitzerland: I) anti-PD-(L)1 agents used only for advanced/metastatic disease, \nand II) anti-PD-(L)1 agents starting in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting. The \nmodel focused on three cancers for which anti-PD-(L)1 agents are currently \napproved in Europe in early stages: melanoma, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and \ntriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), projecting clinical evolution over 10 \nyears. Estimated outcomes included life-years, quality-adjusted life-years \n(QALYs), recurrences/events, active treatments for metastatic disease, adverse \nevents, and deaths.\nRESULTS: Of the estimated 10,659 eligible patients during 2022-2031, 9,050 were \npredicted to initiate neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant treatment with anti-PD-(L)1 \nagents for treatment of melanoma, RCC, or TNBC. Compared to anti-PD-(L)1 agents \nbeing available only in the metastatic setting, use of anti-PD-(L)1 agents in \nthe neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant setting for these 3 cancers was projected to \navoid 1,144 recurrences (a 27% decrease), prevent 1,577 active treatments in the \nmetastatic setting (a 35% decrease), avoid 530 deaths (a 23% decrease), and \nincrease life-years without recurrence by 3,416 (a 10% increase).\nCONCLUSION: The use of anti-PD(L)1 agents to treat early-stage cancers in \nSwitzerland is anticipated to result in better outcomes by preventing \nrecurrences/events, active metastatic treatments, and deaths.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Favre-Bulle, Stankovi\u0107, Mantaian, Frei, Schaefer, Gabriel, \nS\u00f6nmez and Aguiar-Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1601377\nPMCID: PMC12267198\nPMID: 40677709 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: AF-B, MS, CF, SS, and SG are employees of MSD \nSwitzerland, a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ, USA.

While surgical resection remains the mainstay of \ntreatment for localized ccRCC, the persistence of recurrence rates underscores \nthe significant unmet need for effective adjuvant therapies. Recent advancements \nin immunotherapy and targeted therapies have revolutionized the management of \nRCC. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have significantly enhanced antitumor immune \nresponses, whereas tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and mammalian target of \nrapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors effectively disrupt angiogenesis and proliferation \nsignaling pathways, respectively. However, non-clear cell RCC subtypes remain \nunderstudied due to their rarity and exclusion from major clinical trials. \nConsequently, this review primarily focuses on ccRCC, aiming to provide a \ncomprehensive and up-to-date overview of the latest advancements in \nimmunotherapy and targeted therapies. By synthesizing current evidence, this \nreview seeks to elucidate the mechanisms of action, clinical efficacy, and \nlimitations of these treatments, while also identifying gaps in knowledge and \nfuture research directions. Ultimately, the goal is to offer valuable insights \nfor clinicians and researchers, facilitating the development of optimized, \npersonalized treatment approaches to improve outcomes for ccRCC patients.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Wang, Xiang, Liu, Pan, Peng and Ma.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1582887\nPMCID: PMC12267214\nPMID: 40677703 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n15.

This study aimed to explore the transgenerational effects and \nmechanisms of renal developmental toxicity in offspring induced by PDE. We found \nthat PDE caused fetal renal dysplasia and adult glomerulosclerosis phenotype in \nF1-F3 female offspring. Sequencing and experimental assays revealed that PDE \nreduced DNA methylation levels in the promoter region of the imprinted gene \nlncRNA Meg3 (Meg3), increased the expression of Meg3 and reduced the expression \nof the downstream Notch signaling pathway in kidneys of F1-F3 female fetuses. \nMeanwhile, Meg3 expression was increased in oocytes of PDE F1 and F2 offspring. \nThe results of the in vitro experiments confirmed that dexamethasone activates \nGR and reduces DNMT3a expression in primary metanephric mesenchymal stem cells \n(MMSCs), which causes Meg3 hypomethylation/hyperexpression and the inhibition of \nthe Notch signaling pathway, resulting in fetal renal dysplasia. Knockdown of GR \nexpression, overexpression of DNMT3a, or silencing of Meg3 could reverse the \ndownstream-associated alterations. In summary, PDE induced fetal-derived \nglomerulosclerosis phenotype mediated by the GR/DNMT3a/Meg3/Notch signal pathway \nin fetal rats, which had transgenerational inheritance effects and may be \nassociated with increased Meg3 expression transmitted via oocytes. This study \nconfirmed the transgenerational inheritance of fetal-derived glomerulosclerosis \nphenotype induced by PDE and provided an experimental basis for investigating \nthe underlying mechanisms.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

It \nis often difficult to make a definitive diagnosis based on clinical and \nultrasound features alone.\nMETHODS: A total of 40 families with cystic kidney disease from Southwest China \nto meet their genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis needs. To detect renal \ndisease genes, NGS was performed on probands with cystic kidney disease, and \ncandidate variants were validated using Sanger sequencing.\nRESULTS: Among the 40 families, a definitive genetic diagnosis was established \nin 30 cases (30/40, 75.0%), with seven patients having family members who \nsubsequently underwent prenatal diagnosis based on these molecular findings. We \nidentified a total of 38 variants. According to the criteria of the American \nCollege of Medical Genetics and Genomics, 31 variants were classified as \npathogenic or likely pathogenic and sevent were classified as uncertain \nsignificance. Of the 38 variants, 27 were known and 11 were novel.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study expands the mutation spectrum for cystic kidney disease \ngene. Genetic testing is important for clinicians diagnose and guide treatment \npatients with different types of cystic kidney disease accurately. NGS is a \ndetection technology that can be considered, which is effective in avoiding \nunexpected misdiagnoses due to clinical overlap among cystic kidney disease. \nFinally, these results may be useful for the differential diagnosis and genetic \ncounseling of patients with cystic kidney disease.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Recent \nstudies suggest that alterations in free Ub levels may be closely associated \nwith the development of diabetes. However, its levels and functional role in \ndiabetic nephropathy (DN) remain unclear. This study investigated the potential \nof the serum free Ub level as a biomarker for distinguishing DN from \nnon-nephrotic type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its underlying mechanisms in \nDN pathogenesis.\nMETHODS: The type 2 diabetic nephropathy (T2DN, n\u2009=\u200974) and T2DM (n\u2009=\u2009176) \npatients visited the hospital between September 2021 and September 2023 were \nretrospectively analyzed, with clinical indicators collected. The correlation \nbetween serum free Ub level and renal function indicators [serum uric acid \n(SUA), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (Scr), cystatin C (Cys-C), \nurinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), estimated glomerular filtration rate \n(eGFR)], the independent correlation between serum free Ub expression and T2DN \noccurrence, and the diagnostic value of serum free Ub expression for early T2DN \noccurrence in T2DM patients were analyzed by Spearman, Logistic regression, and \nreceiver operating characteristic analyses. The high glucose (HG)-induced renal \ntubular epithelial cell (HK-2 cell) injury model was treated with different \nconcentrations of free Ub. HK-2 cell viability, proliferation and apoptosis, \napoptosis-related protein expression, and interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1\u03b2 \nconcentrations were assessed by CCK-8, EdU staining, flow cytometry, western \nblot and ELISA.\nRESULTS: Compared to the T2DM group, the T2DN group exhibited significantly \nreduced serum free Ub levels, elevated levels of SUA, BUN, Scr, Cys-C, and UACR, \nand decreased eGFR levels. Serum free Ub levels in the T2DN group were \nnegatively correlated with SUA, BUN, Scr, Cys-C, and UACR, and positively \ncorrelated with eGFR. Serum free Ub was an independent influencing factor and \nhad high diagnostic value for early T2DN occurrence in T2DM patients. After HG \n(30 mM) treatment, HK-2 cell viability was significantly reduced, cell \nproliferation was suppressed, and apoptosis was increased, while subsequent free \nUb treatment reversed these effects of HG on cell viability, proliferation, and \napoptosis.\nCONCLUSION: Our data suggest that serum free Ub could predict early T2DN \noccurrence and protect prox\u00ecmal tubule cells from HG-induced apoptosis.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Genetic testing revealed a pathogenic mutation in the \nserine/threonine protein kinase 11 (STK11) gene c.843del frameshift variant \n(p.L282Sfs*5), characterized by guanine deletion at position 843 resulting in \nleucine-to-serine substitution at residue 282, complete alteration of downstream \namino acid sequence, and premature translation termination. In addition, she \nalso presented with MCDK.\nCONCLUSION: This case reveals a potential novel role of STK11 in renal \nembryogenesis, expanding its phenotypic spectrum and challenging the \nconventional paradigm that STK11 mutations solely confer tumor predisposition. \nThrough comprehensive literature review, we propose three mechanistic hypotheses \n- \"metabolo-developmental coupling disruption\", \"ciliopathy-like pathogenesis\", \nand \"epigenetic modulation of developmental plasticity\" - providing new \nmolecular insights into congenital renal anomalies. These findings warrant \nsystematic renal evaluation in PJS patients and exploration of \nmetabolism-targeted therapeutic strategies.\nCLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Clinical and imaging \ncharacteristics were compared between SRH and non-SRH groups, with baseline \ncharacteristics balanced using propensity score matching. Univariate analysis, \nlogistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis \nwere performed to identify SRH risk factors. A predictive nomogram was \nconstructed and internally validated.\nRESULTS: After matching, baseline characteristics were comparable. Protective \nfactors against SRH included posterior perirenal fat thickness \n(HR1\u2009-\u20091.9\u00a0cm=0.25,HR\u2265\u20092\u00a0cm=0.12) and solid tumor (HR\u2009=\u20090.48). Conversely, \nperinephric fat stranding (HRType1=2.68, HRType2=5.13) and the renal tumor \nvascular-to-renal artery diameter ratio (HR\u2009=\u200915.08) were identified as \nsignificant risk factors. ROC analysis showed AUCs of 0.70 for perirenal fat \nthickness, 0.61 for the diameter ratio, and 0.80 for the SRH prediction model. \nThe nomogram demonstrated moderate discrimination, acceptable calibration, and \nclinical utility. Patients with fumarate hydratase deficiency exhibited \ncharacteristic CT findings of cystic-solid tumors, reduced perirenal fat \nthickness, and an increased tumor diameter ratio.\nCONCLUSIONS: Perinephric fat stranding and the renal tumor vascular-to-renal \nartery diameter ratio are significant risk factors for SRH in RCC, while \nperirenal fat thickness and solid tumors are protective. Patients with fumarate \nhydratase deficiency are at increased SRH risk and require special clinical \nattention. The developed nomogram may assist in individualized risk assessment \nand clinical decision-making.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Understanding its burden and key risk factors is \ncrucial for effective interventions.\nMETHODS: Data from the Global Burden of Disease Study (1990-2021) covering 204 \ncountries were analyzed to assess trends in prevalence, mortality, and \ndisability-adjusted life years for chronic kidney disease, alongside geographic, \nage, sex, and risk factor patterns.\nFINDINGS: In 2021, an estimated 674 million individuals were affected globally. \nAlthough the global age-standardized prevalence rate declined slightly by 0.8% \nsince 1990, substantial disparities persisted. High-income North America's \nprevalence remained stable yet showed high mortality (20.6 per 100,000) and \nincreased DALYs (508.8 per 100,000). In contrast, East Asia's prevalence fell by \n11.7%, accompanied by notable reductions in mortality (11.1 per 100,000) and \nDALYs (322.4 per 100,000). Regions with low socio-demographic indices, including \nparts of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, bore the greatest burdens, with \npersistently high prevalence (exceeding 9000 per 100,000) and rising DALYs. Some \ncountries, such as Guatemala, experienced rapid prevalence increases, while \nothers, like Italy, achieved substantial reductions. Similarly, mortality trends \nvaried: Ukraine saw steep increases, while Poland showed marked improvements. \nDALY burdens also diverged, with El Salvador experiencing large increases, and \nKuwait recording significant declines. Prevalence peaked at ages 65-69 in males \nand 70-74 in females, with female rates surpassing male rates from the early \nthirties onward. High fasting plasma glucose contributed 36% of DALYs globally, \nheavily affecting the Caribbean and high-income North America. High systolic \nblood pressure and high body mass index were particularly influential in Central \nEurope and high-income North America, respectively. Low fruit intake strongly \naffected the Middle East and East Asia.\nINTERPRETATION: These findings underscore persistent global inequalities in CKD \noutcomes, necessitating region-specific strategies and strengthened healthcare \ncapacity to mitigate the burden.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Li, Liu, Zhang, Li, Zhang and Li.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fendo.2025.1563246\nPMCID: PMC12267038\nPMID: 40678313 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n21.

Relevant covariates were adjusted, and a multivariable \nlogistic regression model was established to infer the association between \nhandgrip strength and CKD, followed by subgroup analysis. Results: A total of 7 \n295 participants were included in the study, with age of (61.5\u00b113.2) years, and \n55.6% of the study participants were women. The results of the multivariate \nlogistic regression analysis showed that with each 1.0 kg increase in handgrip \nstrength, the risk for CKD decreased by 1.3% (OR=0.987, 95%CI: 0.978-0.997). \nCompared with those with low handgrip strength, the people with moderate \nhasdgrip strength (OR=0.818, 95%CI: 0.694-0.964) and high handgrip strength \n(OR=0.729, 95%CI: 0.598-0.989) had lower risk for CKD. In the subgroup analysis, \nthe association between handgrip strength and risk for CKD remained unchanged \nregardless age, sex, smoking status, and alcohol consumption statuys, and the \nprevalence of hypertension and hyperlipidemia (interaction P>0.05), except BMI \nand diabetes. Conclusion: The decline in handgrip strength is associated with an \nincreased risk for CKD in adult residents in Anhui.\n\nPublisher: \u76ee\u7684\uff1a \u5229\u75282023\u5e74\u4e2d\u56fd\u6210\u4eba\u6162\u6027\u75c5\u53ca\u5371\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u76d1\u6d4b\u5b89\u5fbd\u7701\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5b89\u5fbd\u7701\u6210\u5e74\u5c45\u6c11\u63e1\u529b\u4e0e\u6162\u6027\u80be\u810f\u75c5\uff08CKD\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u5173\u8054\u3002 \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a \n\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u5c42\u6574\u7fa4\u968f\u673a\u62bd\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9009\u53d6\u226518\u5c81\u5c45\u6c11\u8fdb\u884c\u8be2\u95ee\u8c03\u67e5\u3001\u8eab\u4f53\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u5728\u8c03\u6574\u76f8\u5173\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u540e\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u591a\u56e0\u7d20logistic\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u63a8\u65ad\u63e1\u529b\u4e0eCKD\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e9a\u7ec4\u5206\u6790\u3002 \n\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a \u5171\u7eb3\u51657 295\u4eba\uff0c\u5e74\u9f84\u4e3a\uff0861.5\u00b113.2\uff09\u5c81\uff0c55.6%\u4e3a\u5973\u6027\u3002\u591a\u56e0\u7d20logistic\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u63e1\u529b\u6bcf\u589e\u52a01.0 \nkg\uff0cCKD\u60a3\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\u964d\u4f4e1.3%\uff08OR=0.987\uff0c95%CI\uff1a0.978~0.997\uff09\uff1b\u4e0e\u4f4e\u63e1\u529b\u8005\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u4e2d\u63e1\u529b\u8005\uff08OR=0.818\uff0c95%CI\uff1a0.694~0.964\uff09\u548c\u9ad8\u63e1\u529b\u8005\uff08OR=0.729\uff0c95%CI\uff1a0.598~0.989\uff09\u7684CKD\u60a3\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\u964d\u4f4e\u3002\u4e9a\u7ec4\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\uff0c\u9664BMI\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u5916\uff0c\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u6027\u522b\u3001\u73b0\u5728\u5438\u70df\u3001\u996e\u9152\u3001\u9ad8\u8840\u538b\u3001\u8840\u8102\u5f02\u5e38\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5e76\u672a\u6539\u53d8\u63e1\u529b\u4e0eCKD\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff08\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528P>0.05\uff09\u3002 \n\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a \u5b89\u5fbd\u7701\u6210\u5e74\u5c45\u6c11\u63e1\u529b\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0eCKD\u60a3\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\u5347\u9ad8\u6709\u5173\u3002.\n\nDOI: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20241125-00747\nPMID: 40677188 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n22.

Only diagnosis \ncodes were used to identify patients with CKD, with laboratory measurements of \nestimated-glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria unavailable. Utilisation of \nsodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and renin-angiotensin system \n[RAS] inhibitors were evaluated in new users following the first Norwegian \napproval of an SGLT-2 inhibitor for CKD treatment.\nRESULTS: Approximately 3% (125,163 patients) of adults in Norway had diagnosed \nCKD (average age 70 years, 42% women, 73% without T2D). When describing patients \nwith or without T2D, history of heart failure (22% versus 22%), atherosclerotic \ncardiovascular disease (ASCVD; 57% versus 51%), and atrial fibrillation (24% \nversus 27%) were similar. Larger proportions of those with T2D received SGLT-2 \ninhibitors (24% versus 4%) and/or RAS inhibitors (63% versus 47%). \nHospitalisations for CKD (28.1 versus 22.1 events per 100 patient years), heart \nfailure (12.6 versus 9.8), myocardial infarction (3.9 versus 2.2), and stroke \n(3.2 versus 2.3) were more common in patients with CKD and T2D than those \nwithout T2D. However, mortality (10.8 versus 8.5) was higher in patients without \nT2D. CKD and heart failure costs were higher than those for ASCVD, and generally \nhigher in patients with T2D. SGLT-2 inhibitor utilisation increased two-fold the \nyear after its approval but was still low, used mostly at its highest target \ndose. Discontinuation rates were lower with SGLT-2 inhibitors than with RAS \ninhibitors, the latter mostly utilised at low doses.\nCONCLUSIONS: A CKD diagnosis was associated with substantial morbidity and \nmortality, costs, and undertreatment, both in patients with and without T2D. Use \nof novel kidney-protective treatment has increased, but an urgent need to \nimprove the utilisation of kidney-protective medications remains, particularly \nin patients without T2D.\nCLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Clinical guidelines remain lacking with regard to \nrecommendations for using intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) during \nsurgery for RHPT. A prospective randomised study will help evaluate the role of \nIOPTH in guiding surgery for secondary and tertiary RHPT.\nMETHODS/DESIGN: Intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring to guide surgery \nin renal hyperparathyroidism is a pragmatic, multicentre, five-arm, \nparallel-group, patient-blinded and outcome assessor-blinded prospective pilot \ntrial used to evaluate the feasibility of performing a definitive trial. \nEligible participants include adult patients diagnosed with secondary or \ntertiary hyperparathyroidism who are candidates for subtotal or total \nparathyroidectomy. Consenting patients will be randomly assigned, through \ncentral allocation, in a 1:1:1:1:1 fashion to undergo surgery with IOPTH \nmonitoring (four experimental arms: postexcision IOPTH samples taken at 10, 15, \n20 or 25\u2009min) or to undergo surgery without IOPTH monitoring (control arm). The \nprimary feasibility objective is to estimate the percentage of eligible patients \nthat are randomised: \u226570% proceed; 50-69% modify protocol before proceeding; \n<50% fail to proceed. Secondary feasibility outcomes include the percentage of \nenrolled participants with complete data at 6\u2009months trial follow-up (ie, \u226590% \nproceed; 80-89% modify protocol before proceeding; <80% fail to proceed) and the \nrecruitment rate during the trial (ie, \u22655 patients per month to proceed; 2-4 \npatients per month to modify protocol before proceeding; <2 patients per month \nto fail to proceed). We estimate that 60 patients will be needed to achieve the \nprimary feasibility outcome. Descriptive analysis will be conducted for \nfeasibility outcomes. The results of our pilot study will inform the feasibility \nof a definitive trial, and if no major changes to our protocol are indicated, we \nwill treat this study as a vanguard trial and enrol the 60 pilot patients into \nthe definitive trial.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was obtained from the Hamilton \nIntegrated Research Ethics Board.

With limited treatment options, identifying \nbiomarkers related to CKD onset and progression is essential. The complement \nsystem, an immune network, has shown potential involvement in CKD pathogenesiss. \nThis study investigates the causal role of diverse plasma complement proteins in \nCKD and its clinical types to discover new biomarkers and therapeutic targets.\nMETHOD: Using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR), we examined the causal \nrelationships between 28 plasma complement proteins and CKD outcomes. Plasma \ncomplement levels were sourced from a genome-wide association studies involving \n35,559 Icelandic individuals, CKD outcome sourced from the FinnGen R11 and \nkidney function indicators sourced from CKDgen. Protein-protein interactions and \nGO enrichment analyses were used to identify related biological pathways.\nRESULTS: MR analysis identified causal relationships between 19 specific plasma \ncomplement proteins and CKD, 6 of which remained significant after false \ndiscovery rate correction. In addition, CR1 and CFD were not only found to be \nrisk factors for CKD, but were also determined to be positively correlated with \nmembranous nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy, respectively. CD55, C6, CR2, \nCFHR2, CFD were also correlated with renal function indicators, highlighting the \nrole of complement proteins in CKD.\nCONCLUSION: This study supports plasma complement proteins as potential \nbiomarkers and therapeutic targets for CKD. The identified causal associations \nhighlight the relevance of complement activation in CKD progression, suggesting \nfuture potential for clinical applications in early diagnosis, risk \nstratification, and therapeutic intervention.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/0886022X.2025.2525473\nPMID: 40675620 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n25.

P-Coumaric acid (PCA) is a phenolic acid with anti-inflammatory and \nantioxidant pharmacological actions. This research aims to investigate the \neffect of PCA on CKD-induced muscle atrophy and its underlying mechanism. In our \nstudy, in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro models were established by using 5/6 nephrectomized \nrats and LPS-induced C2C12 myoblasts. The experimental results showed that PCA \nameliorated kidney injury in CKD rats and increased skeletal muscle weight and \nthe cross-sectional area of muscle fibres. In both CKD rats and LPS-induced \nC2C12 myoblasts, PCA also exhibited anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, \nreduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhanced the activity of \nantioxidant enzymes. Network pharmacology studies have identified 165 common \ntargets between PCA and skeletal muscle atrophy. Furthermore, the experimental \nresults also demonstrated that PCA decreased the expression of TLR4, MyD88, \nNF-\u03baB p65, MurF1 and MAFbx at both the protein and mRNA levels. Additionally, \nin\u00a0vitro experiments showed that the use of TLR4 agonists could reverse the \nmuscle-protective effect of PCA. In summary, this study illustrated that PCA \nameliorated skeletal muscle atrophy in CKD rats by inhibiting the \nTLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB pathway.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

CSNS was applied daily for \n10\u2009min over 3\u2009days. Cardiac, renal, and inflammatory parameters characterized \nthe CRS1 and the electroceutical effects of CSNS.\nRESULTS: CSNS reduced the ischemic zone compared to the AMI group not exposed to \nCSNS (32.7%\u2009\u00b1\u20092.2% vs. 8.0%\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8%). Heart rate (bpm) was increased in the AMI \ngroup, showing 440\u2009\u00b1\u20097.6 at 48\u2009h and 428\u2009\u00b1\u20091.0 at 60\u2009h post-AMI. Additionally, \narterial pressure (mmHg) was increased in the AMI group at 48\u2009h, as follows: \nmean: 98\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7, diastolic: 89\u2009\u00b1\u20092.1, and systolic: 122\u2009\u00b1\u20095.3. In contrast, the \nCSNS + AMI group showed significant reductions of these parameters: mean: \n79\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0, diastolic, 66\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7, and systolic: 99\u2009\u00b1\u20092.7. Renal injury was \nconfirmed by increased apoptosis in the AMI group. A significant increase in \nTNF-\u03b1 was observed in both heart and kidneys (pg/mg of tissue) in the AMI group \nand reduced IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 levels in the CSNS + AMI group, indicating an \nattenuation of the inflammatory responses by CSNS.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates early cardiac and renal dysfunction in CRS1 \nfollowing AMI, associated with elevated inflammatory markers (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and \nIL-1\u03b2) and renal apoptosis. Therefore, CSNS appears to be a promising \nelectroceutical approach for CRS1. Besides, on the basis of previous studies \nfrom our laboratory, CSNS involves stimulation of the baroreflex, activating the \nparasympathetic and inhibiting the sympathetic nervous system.\n\n\u00a9 2025 Scandinavian Physiological Society.

Our study aims to identify the association between serum calcium and \nall-cause mortality in CHD patients with CKD.\nMETHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted, involving 2,286 \nparticipants from the CHD sub-cohort from the Eastern Guangdong Health and \nDisease Cohort Platform (EGHDCP) and 1,278 participants from National Health and \nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database. Cox proportional hazards \nregression models, stratified analysis with interaction, restricted cubic \nsplines (RCS), and threshold effect analysis were applied to investigate the \nassociation between serum calcium and all-cause mortality of CHD with CKD.\nRESULTS: The association between serum calcium and all-cause mortality of CHD \npatients with CKD from EGHDCP-CHD exhibited an U-shaped curve in RCS, which was \nsimilar to be observed in NHANES cohort. In EGHDCP-CHD cohort, Cox regression \nmodels demonstrated that subjects in the lowest or the highest serum calcium \ngroup had a significantly higher risk of mortality.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of long-term RAAS blocker \nuse on AKI incidence following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).\nMETHODS: Patients undergoing CABG were included in this retrospective cohort \nstudy and divided into control group and medication group. The primary outcome \nwas AKI, while secondary outcomes included the initiation of renal replacement \ntherapy, duration of intensive care unit and total hospitalization, invasive \nventilation time, and intraoperative blood pressure conditions. Propensity score \nmatching (PSM) was used to correct for imbalances in baseline characteristics \nbetween the groups. Lasso regression and multivariate logistic regression were \nemployed to control for confounding factors and to validate the correlation \nbetween medication and AKI. Subgroup and interaction analyses were conducted to \nexamine the heterogeneity of the effect across subgroups. Finally, mediation \neffect analysis was used to explore potential mechanisms and pathways.\nRESULTS: A total of 317 patients were included in the study, with 184 in the \ncontrol group and 133 in the medication group. After PSM, matched cohorts were \nachieved. The medication group had a higher AKI incidence (24.8% versus 10.5%, \np\u2009=\u20090.002) and lower minimum intraoperative diastolic blood pressure (38\u2009\u00b1\u20097 \nversus 40\u2009\u00b1\u20096, p\u2009=\u20090.014). Logistic regression confirmed a significant \nassociation between RAAS blocker use and AKI risk. Subgroup and interaction \nanalyses demonstrated consistent effects across subgroups.\nCONCLUSION: Preoperative long-term use of RAAS blockers significantly increases \nthe risk of AKI in patients undergoing CABG.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/0886022X.2025.2532854\nPMCID: PMC12269056\nPMID: 40670312 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: No potential conflict of interest was reported \nby the author(s).\n\n\n29.

This study aimed to investigate the prognostic factors of \npatients with methanol toxicity referred to Tabriz Sina Hospital.MethodsA \ndescriptive-analytical retrospective study was conducted in methanol toxicity \npatients admitted in Tabriz Sina Hospital since 2019 to 2021. Demographic \ncharacteristics and management methods were extracted from the patients' medical \nrecords.ResultsPatients were predominantly male (91.3%) with a median age of \n30-40\u00a0years. Winter accounted for 48.7% of cases. Coma (OR = 8.0, 95% CI: \n3.2-19.9) and arrhythmia (OR = 5.5, 2.0-15.1) at admission, pH <7.1 (OR = 4.2, \n2.0-8.9), elevated creatinine (OR = 1.3/mg/dL, 1.1-1.6), opiate co-use (OR = \n2.8, 1.2-6.5), and delayed ethanol therapy (>3\u00a0h, OR = 2.3, 1.1-4.8) \nindependently increased mortality risk. Bicarbonate, Eprex, and \nmethylprednisolone reduced complications. Time from ingestion to admission \n(48-72\u00a0h) did not affect mortality, but delayed hemodialysis initiation worsened \noutcomes.ConclusionEarly presentation and providing early therapeutic modalities \nhave a significant impact on the mortality rate and the patients' outcome.\n\nDOI: 10.1177/09603271251358632\nPMID: 40676954 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Declaration of conflicting interestsThe \nauthor(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the \nresearch, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\n\n31.

Due to patient \nsafety concerns about vascular access complications, particularly needle \ndislodgement causing bleeding, various technologies have emerged. The purpose of \nthis study was to investigate whether a novel device (developed by Redsense \nMedical AB) consisting of a sensor placed at the venous puncture site and linked \nto a base unit with wireless connection to a clamp on the venous line is \nacceptable from a patient perspective and feasible for implementation in a home \nhemodialysis program. This was a prospective cohort study of patients undergoing \nhome hemodialysis at the University Health Network in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. \nWe conducted a mixed methods study with a convergent parallel design, collecting \nboth quantitative and qualitative data through two patient questionnaires \nwhereby patients rated their experience with the Redsense system after their \nfirst 1-3 treatments and after their last treatment with the system. Thematic \nanalysis was performed with use of open coding and axial coding. Quantitative \ndata was presented as a heat map depicting participants' scoring of the Redsense \nsystem. Differences between the two questionnaires were assessed by Wilcoxon \nmatched-pairs signed rank tests, and the response to select questions were \ndepicted graphically. 21 patients consented to participate in this study, \ncompleting a total of 218 dialysis treatments with the Redsense system. Over \nthese treatments, the system was shown to be safe and feasible for patients to \nuse independently at home. The alarm had a relatively elevated false positive \nrate for both alarm triggering and clamp closure, with this sentiment well \ndescribed in the qualitative data, as the nuisance of false alarms was a \nfrequent concern described in the post-treatment questionnaire. Patients had \nother negative comments related to the practicality of the alarm system, the \nadditional burden created, and concern about technical issues relating to \nwireless technology. Taken together, the data from this study suggest that most \npatients performing home hemodialysis independently feel that the potential \nbenefits of the Redsense alarm system are outweighed by the additional burden \nand other negatives associated with the system.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Treatment choices should align with patient-centered goals and be \nguided by realistic expectations. However, limited knowledge exists regarding \nthe goals and expectations of older patients for kidney transplantation (KT) and \ndialysis, as well as the extent to which these are met. This study aimed to \nidentify the goals and expectations of older patients for KT and dialysis, to \nassess the achievement of these goals and expectations following KT and dialysis \ninitiation, and to evaluate treatment satisfaction and decision regret.\nMETHODS: This mixed-methods, prospective cohort study included KT recipients and \ndialysis patients aged\u2009\u2265\u200965 years who were suitable for KT. Qualitative data \n(semi-structured interviews) and quantitative data (questionnaires) were \ncollected at baseline, and at six and 24 months after KT or dialysis initiation. \nInterviews were analyzed using quantitative content analyses and questionnaire \ndata with nonparametric tests. Treatment goals and expectations for KT and \ndialysis were identified and categorized into medical, psychological, \nfunctional, and social domains.\nRESULTS: A total of 33 patients KT recipients and 24 dialysis patients aged\u2009\u2265\u200965 \nyears participated. Treatment goals for KT and dialysis were generally fully \nachieved by 50-60% of patients. Patients tended to overestimate the benefits of \nKT and dialysis, and to underestimate the risks associated with KT. However, \nsome benefits of KT and dialysis were not expected by patients but did occur, \nsuch as less interference with their social activities than expected. Moreover, \nthe percentage of KT recipients who fully achieved all their treatment goals \nincreased from 50% at six months post-KT to 90% at 24 months post-KT. Overall, \ntreatment satisfaction was high and decision regret was low in both groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study identified which treatment goals and expectations are \nrealistic for adults aged\u2009\u2265\u200965 years who are eligible for KT. These results can \nbe used to improve patient education programs for kidney failure therapies, and \nto inform shared-decision making processes regarding the choice between KT and \ndialysis.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

We \nhypothesize that higher AVF flow is associated with adverse cardiovascular \noutcomes including an increased incidence of heart failure. We sought to clarify \nthis relationship as understanding this association is crucial for improving \npatient care.\nMETHODS: A comprehensive search of the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases \nwas used to identify observational studies and randomized controlled trials \nreporting an effect of AVF flow on cardiac outcomes (clinical, \nechocardiographic, and biomarker). Due to study heterogeneity, meta-analysis was \nnot feasible. Synthesis without meta-analysis (SWiM) was performed using vote \ncounting of direction of effect as the primary outcome.\nRESULTS: Higher AVF flow rates were consistently associated with increased \nincidence of HF and worsening HF symptoms. Cardiac imaging revealed left \nventricular dilation and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction in patients \nwith high-flow AVFs. Elevated biomarkers, such as natriuretic peptides, \ncorroborated the adverse cardiovascular effects of high AVF flow.\nCONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and synthesis without meta-analysis showed a \npositive relationship between AVF flow and clinical, echocardiographic, and \nbiomarker cardiovascular outcomes. The methodological heterogeneity of studies \nhighlights the need for well-designed prospective research with standardised \ndefinitions of high flow AVFs and measures for reporting of cardiovascular \noutcomes.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Surgical techniques include subtotal \nand total PTx, with or without auto-transplantation, with the choice of \nprocedure generally determined by surgical preference rather than \npatient-related factors. The aim of this study was to compare outcomes of these \nsurgical procedures, focusing on post-operative utilization of hospital \nresources, and biochemical and patient-level outcomes over the year following \nsurgery.\nMETHODS: This retrospective observational study included dialysis patients \nundergoing subtotal or total PTx (\u00b1 auto-transplant) over 9-years at three \ntertiary-level hospitals in Sydney, Australia. Laboratory and \npatient-level-outcomes were compared immediately post-operatively and at one, \nthree and 12-months.\nRESULTS: Of 64 dialysis patients undergoing PTx, 60.9% were male and the mean \ndialysis vintage was 5.9 (4.2) years. Total PTx was performed in 51, 46 with \nauto-transplantation, and subtotal PTx in 13. Patient characteristics were \nsimilar at baseline. Compared to subtotal PTx, total PTx resulted in lower \npost-operative calcium values (p\u2009=\u20090.01), higher intravenous calcium \nrequirements (p\u2009=\u20090.03) and more frequent admission to intensive care \n(p\u2009=\u20090.03). After total PTx, the daily calcium and calcitriol pill burden at \ndischarge was higher (median 25 (IQR 20-40) vs. 18 (IQR 6-26), p\u2009=\u20090.04) and at \n3-months (p\u2009=\u20090.01), and 23.5% of patients were readmitted for calcium \nmanagement (p\u2009=\u20090.05). At 12-months, more patients undergoing subtotal PTx had \nPTH values above guideline recommendations (42.9% vs. 9.3%, p\u2009=\u20090.02), pill \nburdens did not differ, and bone mineral density increased in both groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Total PTx requires greater post-operative resources but is \nassociated with lower PTH values at 12-months, whereas subtotal PTx is \nassociated with a lower pill burden but increased hyperparathyroidism \nrecurrence. A tailored strategy is suggested, matching the surgical approach to \npatient needs.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

The prevalence of chronic limb-threatening ischemia was 52.2% \n(444/850 patients) vs 22.1% (437/1,977 patients). Lutonix was used in 30.6% \n(688/991 lesions) vs 21.3% (462/2,174 lesions), and IN.PACT Admiral was used in \n69.4% (303/991 lesions) vs 78.7% (1,712/2,174 lesions). After propensity-score \nmatching, the 1- and 3-year rates of freedom from restenosis in the HD and \nnon-HD groups were 82.2% (95% CI: 79.0%-85.3%) vs 85.8% (83.0%-88.7%) at 1 year \nand 61.9% (57.7%-66.1%) vs 66.3% (62.2%-70.4%) at 3 years, respectively. In the \nHD group, restenosis occurred in 363 lesions during a median follow-up of 16.2 \nmonths (Q1-Q3: 7.2-35.5 months). Factors independently associated with \nrestenosis risk in the HD group were no below-the-knee runoff, history of \nendovascular therapy, popliteal lesion, severe calcification, use of Lutonix, \nand severe dissection.\nCONCLUSIONS: DCB endovascular therapy is a reasonable treatment for \nfemoropopliteal lesions in patients on HD.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

Several studies confirm the relationship between oral and systemic \nconditions of patients. Therefore, CKD and periodontal disease can be related \nbecause they are both inflammatory conditions that further increase the risk of \nother pathologies. The impact of CKD on oral health and overall quality of life \nis an area of interest.\nOBJECTIVES: To evaluate patients with CKD undergoing renal replacement therapy \nregarding the levels of self-perception of oral health and quality of life.\nDESIGN SETTING: This case-control study was conducted jointly at the \nUniversidade de Passo Fundo and Hospital S\u00e3o Vicente de Paulo, Brazil.\nMETHODS: This study included two patient groups: 1) Case group with CKD (CGA) \ncomprising 116 patients; 2) Control group without CKD (CGO) composed of 124 \npatients. We used a structured questionnaire and the Oral Health Impact Profile \n(OHIP-14). We used the Chi-square and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests as well as an \nanalysis of variance measure (P < 0.05).\nRESULTS: The systemic diseases most prevalent among our patient cohort included \nhypertension (16.9% CGO and 75.9% CGA) and diabetes mellitus (8.9% CGO and 38.8% \nCGA). The systemic health perception was good in 66.9% of the CGO group and \naverage in 42.2% of CGA group members. Oral health perception was good in 46% of \nCGO and 50% of CGA group members. Results of the self-assessment for quality of \nlife showed a statistically significant difference between the groups for \nphysical domain, physical disability, and social disadvantage. A comparison \nbetween the control and case (CKD) groups, based on the OHIP-14 score, showed \nstatistically significant differences in the functionality (P < 0.006), physical \ndisability (P < 0.042), and social disadvantage (P < 0.031) domains for the CKD \ngroup.\nCONCLUSION: Patients with CKD have lower rates of self-perception of oral health \nand quality of life than individuals without CKD.\n\nDOI: 10.1590/1516-3180.2024.0144.R1.14042025\nPMCID: PMC12263087\nPMID: 40667934 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Conflicts of interest: None.\n\n\n37.

The Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) and WHOQoL BREF questionnaire measured \ncaregiver burden and QoL. The qualitative data was gathered through in-depth \ninterviews using a semi-structured open-ended questionnaire that delved into \ntheir personal experiences with caregiving. The transcripts of these interviews \nwere analysed using applied thematic analysis, allowing for the identification \nand exploration of recurring themes and patterns within the data.\nRESULTS: A total of 105 caregivers took part in this study, with a mean age of \n40.04\u2009\u00b1\u200912.96 years. 56 (53.3%) caregivers were female. Most (48.6%, n\u2009=\u200951) \nwere spouses/partners. Ten caregivers (9.5%) had to change their occupations due \nto caregiving responsibilities. 14 (23.33%) had comorbidities (diabetes, \nhypertension, asthma, and arthritis) themselves. The mean caregiver burden level \n(ZBI) was 18.55\u2009\u00b1\u20097.58. Most (59.0%) experienced mild to moderate burden, while \n28.6% reported a high burden. The WHOQoL BREF mean score of various domains of \nphysical health, psychological, social relationship and environmental was \n35.70\u2009\u00b1\u200912.14, 44.20\u2009\u00b1\u200913.28, 44.28\u2009\u00b1\u200915.10 and 40.07\u2009\u00b1\u200913.36 respectively. The \nthematic analysis revealed, difficulty in continuing education and employment, \nchanging jobs, the need to travel long distances to reach dialysis facilities \nand hardship due to COVID-19 pandemic as recurring challenges among caregivers.\nCONCLUSION: Caregivers of Hemodialysis patients had significant caregiver burden \nand poor QoL.

This study aims to investigate the \nassociation between exercise and abdominal wall complications in the PD \npopulation.\nMETHODS: A retrospective data analysis of a prospective cohort. Abdominal wall \ncomplications were recorded during follow-up. Exercise characteristics were \ncollected monthly by outpatient questionnaire, including whether the patient \nexercised, type of exercise, exercise duration, and exercise intensity. \nCompeting risk models were used to evaluate the predictive power of exercise \nvariables for the occurrence of abdominal wall complications.\nRESULTS: Among the 475 patients undergoing PD, 33 (6.9%) developed abdominal \nwall complications during a median follow-up of 46.0 months. A total of 377 \n(79.4%) patients engaged in regular exercise, with walking (99.5%) being the \npredominant form. Only 2 (0.5%) patients combined aerobic and resistance \nexercise. The median exercise duration was 210.0\u00a0min per week (interquartile \nrange: 140.0-350.0\u00a0min). No exercise characteristics, including exercise \nparticipation, exercise duration per week, or exercise intensity, were found to \nbe associated with abdominal wall complications in either univariate or \nmultivariate competing risk analyses. Similarly, exercise variables showed no \nsignificant prognostic value in any subgroup analyses.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates for the first time that exercise, primarily \nin the form of aerobic activity at typical duration and intensity levels, does \nnot increase the risk of abdominal wall complications in PD patients. Further \nresearch is needed to explore the effects of high-intensity aerobic exercise and \nresistance training in the PD population.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: This study did not involve any interventions, and all the \ndata were obtained from the PDTAP database (Registration number: NCT03571451; \nRegistration date: 2018-06-20). We adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\nPlain Language Summary: 1. The relationship between exercise and abdominal wall \ncomplications is actually controversial in previous research in general \npopulation. In the peritoneal dialysis (PD) population, the relationship is \nrarely reported. 2. Our results firstly indicated that exercise, primarily in \nthe modality of mild-to-moderate aerobic exercise, is not associated with the \nrisk for abdominal wall complications in the whole cohort and all subgroups \nthrough this single-center PD cohort. Since regular exercise training is \nassociated with better physical function, increased health-related quality of \nlife and reduced mortality in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, our study \nprovided the evidence of exercise counselling in the PD population. 3. Our \nfindings on mild-to-moderate aerobic exercise do not preclude the potential \nimpact of high-intensity aerobic exercise or resistance exercise on abdominal \nwall complications. Future research should be conducted to provide comprehensive \nevidence for exercise counseling in the PD population.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Here, we demonstrate a single-step, \nenergy-efficient bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BMED) system integrated with \nCCU, enabling the simultaneous conversion of NaCl brine and CO2 into high-purity \nsodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) with unprecedented efficiency, but without requiring \nexternal alkali sources or energy-intensive thermal regeneration steps. By \noptimizing key parameters - such as current density and CO2 aeration rate, and \ngas-liquid flow ratios - we achieved a bicarbonate concentration of 1.186 mol/L \nin the alkaline chamber, coupled with 57.65% carbon sequestration efficiency and \nan energy consumption as low as 3.1 kW\u00b7h/m\u00b3 CO2 (or 716.9 kW\u00b7h/t NaHCO3). This \napproach not only recovers valuable sodium resources from brine but also \nenhances CO2 absorption through electrochemical mechanisms, potentially reducing \nglobal carbon emissions by up to 20% in brine-intensive industries. Our work \npaves the way for scalable, sustainable CCUS technologies, transforming waste \nstreams into economic assets and advancing the fight against climate change.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Authors This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of \nthe Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC BY 4.0), which permits copying, \nadaptation and redistribution, provided the original work is properly cited \n(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\n\nDOI: 10.2166/wst.2025.085\nPMID: 40662903 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare there is no conflict.\n\n\n40.

Traditional methods \nfor assessing fluid status lack sensitivity and specificity, necessitating the \ndevelopment of more reliable techniques. Remote dielectric sensing (ReDS) offers \nrapid, non-invasive, and quantitative lung fluid measurements, potentially \naiding fluid management in this population.\nMETHODS: In this prospective cross-sectional study, patients on chronic \nmaintenance haemodialysis were invited to participate between March and June \n2022. ReDS measurements were performed immediately before and after \nhaemodialysis to assess pulmonary congestion, defined as ReDS values exceeding \n35%. Ultrafiltration volumes, intradialytic hypotension, and associated risk \nfactors were analysed.\nRESULTS: Among 58 analysed haemodialysis patients (mean age 76\u2009years; 43% male), \n48% exhibited pulmonary congestion pre-haemodialysis (mean ReDS: 37%), with 33% \nremaining congested post-haemodialysis despite a 4% average reduction. \nUltrafiltration volumes averaged 1.4\u2009L and showed a weak correlation with ReDS \nchanges (Pearson's r\u2009=\u20090.309, p\u2009=\u20090.018). Intradialytic hypotension occurred in \n21% of patients and was associated with hypoalbuminaemia (75% vs. 46%; \np\u2009=\u20090.070), and was less common in hypertensive individuals (50% vs. 78%; \np\u2009=\u20090.072). ReDS measurements did not predict intradialytic hypotension.\nCONCLUSION: ReDS is a valuable tool for assessing pulmonary congestion in \nhaemodialysis patients, detecting fluid overload both before and after sessions. \nPulmonary congestion often persists despite achieving dry weight, highlighting \nthe need for precise fluid management. While ReDS shows promise for clinical \nuse, further longitudinal studies are essential to validate its prognostic value \nand refine its application in haemodialysis care.\n\n\u00a9 2025 Asian Pacific Society of Nephrology.\n\nDOI: 10.1111/nep.70095\nPMID: 40660795 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"}
