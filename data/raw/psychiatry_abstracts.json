This study \naimed to develop a set of EPAs tailored to the psychiatric residency training \ncontext with local institutional needs, and to dissect the differences and \nfactor analysis in perceived EPA importance.\nMETHODS: 21 customized EPAs specific to psychiatric residency training at Taipei \nCity Psychiatric Center (TCPC) were developed based on the Taiwanese Society of \nPsychiatry (TSOP) framework. A two-round Delphi method was used to achieve \nconsensus for the EPAs. The finalized EPAs were evaluated using an online \nquestionnaire, and faculty members and residents rated each activity's \nimportance on a Likert scale of 0-10. Statistical analyses were performed on \nperceptions differences between teachers and trainees, and to cluster EPAs into \nmeaningful competency clusters.\nRESULTS: The finalized TCPC EPA framework included the TSOP's original 17 EPAs \nand four additional EPAs to address advanced skills in psychotherapy, \nrehabilitation, legal applications, and innovative technologies. The total \nresponse rate was 89.6% for questionnaire assessing importance. Faculty \nconsistently rated EPAs as more important than residents did, particularly \nclinical documentation, teaching and long-term care planning. Factor analysis \nrevealed two loading factors, referring to internal knowledge and an external \ncommunication.\nCONCLUSION: The experience of adapting EPAs from global and national standards \nto fit the characteristics of a local training institution provides a valuable \nreference for the localization of EPA development. Observed differences in \nperceptions between trainees and teachers highlight the importance of aligning \neducational expectations. Enhancing awareness of the underlying dimensions \nassociated with EPAs may help optimize psychiatric training outcomes for both \ntrainees and instructors.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

However, disclosing sexual orientation and gender identity \nin health care presents risks to patients.\nMETHODS: We collected surveys from 174 cancer hospital patients to understand \ntheir perspectives on safety associated with sexual orientation and gender \nidentity data collection.\nRESULTS: Overall, 18.4% of participants identified as sexual or gender \nminorities. Sexual and gender minority participants were more likely to report \nexperiencing unequal treatment in health care than participants who did not \nidentify as a sexual or gender minority. Most patients felt safe or comfortable \nanswering sexual orientation and gender identity questions and having \nhealth-care professionals within their health system view their data. Fewer \nwanted data available to front-desk staff or shared to other health systems. Few \nthought sexual orientation and gender identity was important to health care. \nMost believed their data would be kept safe and private; patient concerns \nincluded stigma, privacy, and data vulnerability.\nCONCLUSIONS: Better policy protections and data segmentation are needed to \nachieve patient safety and health-care quality related to sexual orientation and \ngender identity data collection.\n\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2025.

This paper fills the gap in knowledge by examining the \ndistinct patterns for achieving offshore secrecy among elites in 65 countries. \nWe take a cross-national comparative perspective, showing that the patterns are \ncontingent in part on political conditions in the elites' home countries. Using \ndata from two publicly available sources- the Offshore Leaks Database and the \nWorld Justice Project Rule of Law Index-we advance knowledge for scholars and \npolicy-makers with three main results. First, we find that elites from corrupt \ncountries are more likely to spread their assets across multiple offshore \nfinancial centers: they diversify across the system, instead of putting all \ntheir eggs in one basket. Second, countries where the risk of government \nconfiscation of private assets is high-either due to lack of civil rights or \nvery effective law enforcement-elites make heavy use of identity-concealing \noffshore strategies such as bearer instruments and nominees to shield their \nnames from discovery in public records. Third, elites from countries where both \ncorruption and confiscation pose significant risks make extensive use of \nblacklisted offshore financial centers, despite the reputational and practical \nrisks that entails for them. All three patterns achieve secrecy, but through \ndifferent means; our findings have implications for public policy, as well as \nfor models of inequality, elites, and financial crime.\n\nCopyright: \u00a9 2025 Chang et al.

Sociodemographic data, PM \nawareness, understanding, PM-related keyword before and after a brief \nintroduction to PM, and educational needs concerning PM were collected.\nRESULTS: PM awareness, understanding, and educational needs concerning PM \ndiffered significantly between groups. The doctor group reported a significantly \nhigher PM awareness and understanding, and there were significant differences \nbetween the groups regarding the frequently-selected PM-related keywords. In the \ndoctor group, they were \"digestion,\" \"functional,\" \"irritable bowel syndrome,\" \n\"pain,\" \"psychogenic,\" and \"somatic symptom disorder\" in the general public \ngroup, they were \"brain,\" \"cause,\" \"influence,\" \"mind,\" \"panic disorder,\" \n\"problem,\" \"psychology,\" \"response,\" and \"treatment.\" Additionally, the brief \nintroduction to PM improved PM awareness in both groups. There was a significant \ndifference in the frequently-selected PM-related keywords after the brief \nintroduction. In the doctor group, the words significantly more selected were \n\"association,\" \"concept,\" \"connection,\" and \"influence\" and the word \nsignificantly less selected was \"mind.\" In the general public group, the words \nsignificantly more selected were \"association,\" \"connection,\" \"irritable bowel \nsyndrome,\" and \"somatic symptom disorder,\" and the words significantly less \nselected were \"autonomic nervous system,\" \"brain,\" \"menopause,\" \"panic \ndisorder.\" The two groups also diverged in their educational needs concerning \nPM. The most frequently selected needs in the doctor group were \"stress and \nchronic pain,\" \"mental health issues in cancer patients,\" and \"stress and \ngastrointestinal disorders\" in the general public, they were \"how to self-manage \nstress,\" \"stress and chronic pain,\" and \"medical treatments for stress.\"\nCONCLUSION: Doctors identified more PM-specific terms, whereas the general \npublic had a vaguer understanding of PM. Even a brief education intervention \nsignificantly helped align the perceptions of both groups with current PM \ntheory, highlighting the impact of education. Regarding PM educational content \nrecommendations, the focus should be on stress education for the general public \nand on practical assessment and management of psychosomatic disorders for \ndoctors.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.\n\nDOI: 10.3346/jkms.2025.40.e138\nPMCID: PMC12260601\nPMID: 40662651 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors have no potential conflicts of \ninterest to disclose.\n\n\n5.

Traditional consideration of \nindividual identifiability does not account for the growing recognition that \nalmost all data can be reidentified. This leaves the research ethics community \nperforming a \"theater of anonymity\": weighing benefit versus risk on the \ninclusion of participant identifiers alone. The wider research community, \nincluding U.S. federal agencies, is pushing for greater transparency and data \nsharing, stretching the current definition of identifiability to the breaking \npoint. Additionally, shifting attitudes on the balance between privacy and \nresearch benefit may make a project more acceptable to individuals and \ncommunities than to the ethics boards designed to serve them. Reviewing the \nhuman research community's historical and current understanding of identity in \nterms of research, risk, benefit, and consent may point toward a need for a \nchange in how consent is conceived. Particularly in the context of consent for \nbig health data research, the research ethics community may need to shift its \nfocus from solely considering individuals toward actively considering the \ninterests of the communities most likely to be affected by the research.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

It plays a major role in policy planning and \nimplementation, quality improvement, clinical decision-making, care continuity, \ndisease surveillance, etc., making it an integral part of healthcare delivery. \nThis substantiates the pressing need for an appropriate information governance \n(IG) system, ensuring proper data stewardship, measures to ensure data quality \nand that preserving the privacy and confidentiality of patient data are in \nplace. As part of conscious efforts to improve health information governance, \nthis study examines the entire information governance structure of healthcare \nfacilities used as study areas, taking into account the effectiveness of data \nstewardship, data quality management and compliance with regulatory \nrequirements.\nMETHODOLOGY: Employing a cross-sectional study design, data was collected from \n432 healthcare professionals emanating from Cape Coast Teaching Hospital (CCTH), \nEastern Regional Hospital Koforidua (ERHK) and Ledzokuku-Krowor Municipal \nAssembly (LEKMA) Hospital, all in Ghana. A semi-structured questionnaire, \ndemarcated into five (5) parts, was used to collect the data. Closed-ended \nquestions were analyzed with Stata 15.0 involving frequencies, percentages, \nmeans, standard deviation, standard errors and confident intervals. A chi-square \ntest of independence was deployed to ascertain relationships between variables. \nOpen-ended questions were coded and analyzed with Qualitative Data Analysis \nMiner 6.0, deploying inductive thematic analysis.\nRESULTS: The level of understanding of data stewardship (2.87/4.0), familiarity \nwith concepts of data quality (2.73/5.0) and ethical considerations and privacy \n(3.13/5.0) when dealing with patient health data were found to be varied among \nthe professionals, overall rated as moderate and affirming the need for \nimprovement. The level of knowledge and understanding on these pertinent areas \nwere highly influenced by type of profession (p\u2009<\u20090.001; p\u2009=\u20090.031 and, \np\u2009<\u20090.001) respectively and been indicative that some type of health workers is \nmuch concerned about data stewardship and health information governance than \nothers. Various methods and efforts were in place to ensure the quality of data; \nhowever, hampering these attempts included factors such as poor data collection \nmethods, lack of resources, inadequate competency and some behavioral factors. \nIn addition to these factors is the low level of training on data stewardship \n(1.86/4.0), which heavily leads to skewness in knowledge. The majority of \nhealthcare professionals were familiar with and advocated for adherence to \nregulatory requirements such as HIPAA (33.7%), GDPR (21.3%) and HITECH Act \n(14.4%), in making data governance much robust. Efforts were also identified in \nensuring privacy and confidentiality during the storage, processing and \ntransmission of patient data mostly by deploying methods such as authentication \n(58.9%), use of secured computers and software (71.2%) and using secure \nelectronic platforms (66.0%) respectively indicating a keen attention for data \nstewardship and governance. About 70% of healthcare professionals attested to \nthe regular conduct of monthly compliance audits, however, the rate of training \non data stewardship was discovered to be very low (1.86/4.0).\nCONCLUSION: There is an existence of clear policies and procedures to guide data \nstewardship to enhance overall information governance, however, healthcare \nprofessionals' level of knowledge on subjects of information governance ought to \nbe enhanced. There is a need to intensify training sessions on data quality, and \nregulatory requirements for health information governance to mitigate the gaps \nin knowledge among professionals.\n\nCopyright: \u00a9 2025 Okyere Boadu et al.

Twelve psychiatrists who \nhad left permanent positions in public mental health services in the last 5 \nyears were recruited. Semi-structured interviews were recorded, transcribed and \nanalysed using thematic analysis.\nRESULTS: Four themes were identified: \"a burnout job\", \"responsibility and \naccountability but without authority\", \"a lot of near misses\" and \"inertia\". \nParticipants reported an excessive workload in an under-resourced and \ninefficient system. They reported that their role within the multidisciplinary \nteam had changed, and that their professional skills were undervalued. They felt \naccountable for poor patient outcomes but unable to improve the quality of care \nprovided. Participants were concerned about their safety at work and reported a \ndesire to improve efficacy, safety and quality of care but believed that the \nsystem was non-responsive and resistant to change. Consequently, they reported \nfeeling no option but to leave.\nCONCLUSION: Retention of psychiatrists in public mental health services may be \nimproved by increasing resourcing, embracing innovative change, recognising the \nunique role of a psychiatrist within the multidisciplinary team and promoting \npositive organisational culture and medical leadership.\n\n\u00a9 PMA.\n\nDOI: 10.26635/6965.6977\nPMID: 40638931 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Nil.\n\n\n9.

Methods of \ntheoretical analysis, system-analytical and comparative-legal methods made it \npossible to characterise the problems of protecting the right of an individual \nto privacy in medical legal relations, taking into account the practice of the \nECtHR.\nRESULTS: Results: The right to privacy in medical legal relations is a \nfundamental principle of the legal systems of the states parties to the European \nConvention. The right to privacy in medical legal relations is complex and forms \npart of the right to health. The ECtHR, in many of its decisions in the field of \nhealthcare, has emphasised the existence of both negative and positive \nobligations of the state to ensure the right to respect for the private and \nfamily life of patients. States parties to the European Convention must not only \nrefrain from unlawful interference, but also create mechanisms for the effective \nprotection of patients'privacy, including the protection of confidential data.\nCONCLUSION: Conclusions: The practice of the ECtHR in implementing an \nindividual's right to privacy in medical legal relations is a dynamic source of \nlaw and contributes to the formation of uniform judicial practice in the context \nof protecting the rights, freedoms and interests of individuals in the field of \nhealthcare.\n\nDOI: 10.36740/Merkur202503118\nPMID: 40633085 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n10.

To facilitate an unbiased \nreading of the empirical articles in this thematic issue, this essay therefore \nuses the history of a particularly contested area of 'survival research', spirit \nmediumship, to highlight widely forgotten but pivotal historical contexts and \ncomplexities which have failed to inform and balance standard academic \nreceptions of empirical approaches to the mind's hypothetic survival of death. \nAfter sketching diametrically opposed attitudes to mediumship by the founders of \nmodern psychology, William James and Wilhelm Wundt, and psychiatrist Eugen \nBleuler's defences of research with mediums against the dismissive stance \nexemplified by Emil Kraepelin and Henry Maudsley, I conclude that standard \ninterpretations of any open-minded scientific interest in mediumship and \nsurvival research as wishful thinking are asymmetrical and psychologically \nsimplistic.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/09540261.2024.2421403\nPMID: 40627516 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n13.

The sample was split, by current symptoms of social anxiety \nand post-traumatic stress related to bullying, into a lower symptoms group \n(n\u2009=\u200912) and a higher symptoms group (n\u2009=\u20098).Results: Participants reported \nmultiple types of bullying, including online. Four superordinate themes were \nidentified in negative beliefs related to bullying experiences: personal \ndeficiency (i.e. victimization was due to own low value or undesirable traits), \nsocial threat (i.e. wariness of others due to their negative motives or traits), \nacceptance is fragile (i.e. being accepted by others is transient and requires \neffort), and minimizing (i.e. downplaying severity and impact of past \nexperiences). These were evident in both groups but were more frequently \nendorsed in the higher symptoms group.Conclusion: Negative appraisals related to \nbullying can persist into young adulthood and may influence social interactions \nand mental health. Interventions targeting these beliefs could mitigate negative \noutcomes and bolster resilience among individuals affected by bullying. Further \nresearch should explore these themes to inform effective therapeutic strategies \nfor young adults who have been bullied.\n\nPlain Language Summary: This paper explores negative beliefs about bullying, \nself, and other people among young adults who were bullied.Themes were \nidentified in negative beliefs related to bullying experiences that were common \nacross the sample and elevated among those with higher social anxiety or \npost-traumatic stress symptoms related to bullying.Negative appraisals related \nto bullying can persist into young adulthood, and interventions targeting these \nbeliefs could mitigate negative outcomes.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/20008066.2025.2523638\nPMID: 40678849 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n14.

These \ndisorders, including postoperative delirium and sustained cognitive decline, \nsignificantly reduce patient quality of life and impose substantial burdens on \nhealthcare systems. Despite extensive research, the underlying \npathophysiological mechanisms remain inadequately understood, limiting the \ndevelopment of effective treatments. Increasing evidence highlights \nneuroinflammation as a central factor in PND, with microglia-the resident immune \ncells of the central nervous system-playing a key role in mediating inflammatory \nresponses that lead to cognitive dysfunction.\nMETHODS: This review comprehensively analyzes the role of microglia in the \npathogenesis of PND. It details key perioperative triggers of microglial \nactivation, such as surgical stress, anesthesia, and systemic inflammation. The \nreview further examines preclinical interventions aimed at modulating microglial \nfunction, including depletion strategies, polarization toward anti-inflammatory \nphenotypes, and inhibition of inflammatory pathways like NF-\u03baB and NLRP3.\nRESULTS: Preclinical studies demonstrate that dysregulated microglial activation \nresults in excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, \nand synaptic disruptions, which collectively contribute to neuronal injury and \ncognitive impairment. Interventions targeting microglial activation have shown \nefficacy in reducing neuroinflammation and preserving cognitive function in \nanimal models.\nCONCLUSIONS: Targeting microglial activation represents a promising strategy for \nalleviating PND. However, challenges remain in clinical translation, \nnecessitating advanced drug delivery platforms, personalized therapeutic \napproaches, and rigorous clinical validation. Advances in microglial modulation \nhold potential for improving postoperative cognitive outcomes and enhancing \npatient recovery.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

This study examined the changes in and correlates of \ncannabis-involved substance use treatment admissions among this demographic.\nMETHODS: Using the 2000-2021 concatenated Treatment Episode Data Set-Admissions \n(TEDS-A) age 50+ (N=5,593,004), we fitted joinpoint regression models to examine \nchanges in the percent of cannabis-involved admissions of all substance use \nadmissions. We used multinomial and binary logistic regression models to examine \nthe demographic and treatment-related correlates of cannabis-primary admissions \nand cannabis-secondary/tertiary admissions.\nRESULTS: During the study period, the number of cannabis-involved admissions \nincreased substantially, while their share of all admissions increased and then \ndecreased as other drug-related admissions increased. The annual percentage \nchanges (APC) show that the shares of cannabis-involved admissions of all \nadmissions between 2000 and 2012 increased for the 50-64 age group and then \ndecreased between 2012 and 2021. In the 65+ age group, the shares increased \nbetween 2000 and 2016 (APC=5.2) and then plateaued. Compared to no-cannabis \nadmissions, the likelihood (relative risk ratio) of all cannabis-involved \nadmissions was higher among males, black people, residents of states where \nmedical or recreational cannabis use was legal, and referrals from healthcare \nproviders and court/criminal legal systems. The likelihood (adjusted odds ratio \n[AOR]) of cannabis-primary admissions was higher among those age 65+ (aOR=1.04, \n95%CI=1.00-1.08), black people (aOR=1.34, 95% CI=1.32-1.36), Hispanic people \n(aOR=1.26, 95% CI=1.23-1.29), residents of states with medical cannabis laws, \nand those who were referred by healthcare providers and legal systems.\nIMPLICATIONS: Cannabis-involved admissions are projected to continue to increase \nas cannabis use continues to increase. More effective regulations and \nenforcement of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol potency and research on cannabis \nharms and poly-substance use are needed to protect the health of older adults \nwho turn to cannabis for its purported health benefits. Increased availability \nand accessibility of treatment infrastructure are also needed.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Choi, Marti and Choi.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fpubh.2025.1592551\nPMCID: PMC12267244\nPMID: 40678640 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n16.

The COVID-19 pandemic has \naccelerated the transformation of healthcare services, emphasizing the use of \ndigital resources. Given the rapid brain development in infants in the first \n1,000\u202fdays of life and the demonstrated impact of adaptive neuroplasticity, the \nimplementation of early and ecological interventions are essential for \nsupporting optimal neurodevelopment in this vulnerable population. Aim of this \nproject is to develop a digital tool for parent-led parent-based intervention \nand assess its feasibility and accessibility.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected evidence on early intervention strategies \nfor preterm infants through a non-systematic review of current literature to \ndevelop the platform and created an ad-hoc questionnaire to evaluate the tool's \nfeasibility and acceptability in our neurological follow-up.\nRESULTS: \"NE@R\" is a digital platform designed to support neurodevelopment \nthrough parents-delivered play. The platform offers evidence-based information, \nvideos, and practical activities to enhance motor, cognitive, social, and \nlanguage development at each developmental phase. We introduce the resource in \nour clinical setting and collect 100 preterm infants' families feedback. The \nmajority of parents reported finding the resource beneficial, with many \nexpressing increased confidence in supporting their child's development.\nDISCUSSION: Preterm babies families' support represents a precious field of \nintervention both for parents and infants at risk. \"NE@R\" has proven to be an \neffective, low-cost tool within our follow-up program, aligning with the \nprinciples of family-centered care.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Trussardi, Naboni, Caporali, Pisoni, Ghirardello and Orcesi.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fpubh.2025.1597244\nPMCID: PMC12267281\nPMID: 40678635 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n17.

Baduanjin \nexercise, a low-cost traditional Chinese mind-body exercise, demonstrates \nconsiderable potential for assisting older adults in managing cognitive \nimpairment. However, there is no consensus regarding its efficacy. This \nmeta-analysis aimed to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of Baduanjin \nexercise in ameliorating cognitive impairment in older adults.\nMETHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published through January 30, 2025, \nwere searched in PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase, \nClinicalTrials.gov, and Chinese databases (CSTJ, CNKI, Wanfang). Two reviewers \nindependently conducted trial selection, assessed methodological quality using \nthe Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, and extracted data in accordance with PRISMA \nguidelines. Seven RCTs involving 539 community-dwelling older adults met the \ninclusion criteria.\nRESULTS: Baduanjin exercise significantly improved global cognitive function \n[mean difference (MD)\u202f=\u202f2.15; 95% CI, 1.53 to 2.76; p\u202f< 0.00001], memory \n(standardized mean difference\u202f=\u202f0.59; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.80; p\u202f< 0.00001), \nexecutive function (SMD\u202f=\u202f0.26; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.44; p\u202f= 0.007), and physical \nhealth (MD\u202f=\u202f-0.86; 95% CI, -0.26 to -0.46; p\u202f< 0.00001). No included study \nreported adverse effects related to Baduanjin exercise.\nCONCLUSION: These findings indicate that Baduanjin exercise can effectively \nimprove cognitive impairment in older adults. Nevertheless, further rigorously \ndesigned RCTs are required to confirm these findings.\nSYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: International Platform of Registered Systematic \nReview and Meta-Analysis Protocols (INPLASY) under the registration number \nINPLASY202460007, https://inplasy.com/inplasy-2024-6-0007/.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Gong, Wang, Yang, Liu, Zhang and Zhang.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fpubh.2025.1586011\nPMCID: PMC12267035\nPMID: 40678632 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n18.

While most individuals \nrecover HPGA function following androgen cessation, a subset experiences \nprolonged hypogonadism, with symptoms persisting for months or even years. \nCurrently, this condition lacks a standardized definition, complicating both \ndiagnosis and treatment. In this article, we explore the potential mechanisms \nunderlying prolonged hypogonadism after androgen abuse, including the role of \nprolonged androgen activity, hypothalamic-pituitary alterations, testicular \nchanges, suppression of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), genetic \npredisposition, and undisclosed ongoing androgen abuse. We propose the term \n'Prolonged Post-Androgen Abuse Hypogonadism'(PPAAH) to standardize diagnosis and \nguide future research. PPAAH is provisionally defined as persistent hypogonadism \nsix months after cessation of androgen abuse, in individuals with a cumulative \nandrogen exposure of at least 150 mg per week for a minimum of six months. \nDiagnosing PPAAH requires excluding other causes of hypogonadism. This \npreliminary framework is intended to support further research into the \npathophysiology and management of this condition, and may require refinement as \nfurther evidence emerges.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 van Os, Smit, Bond and de Ronde.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fendo.2025.1621558\nPMCID: PMC12267013\nPMID: 40678315 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n19.

The relationship between poly-victimization and PTSS was partially \nmediated by mentalizing (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009.17, 95%-CI [.06, .38], p\u2009=\u2009.002).Conclusions: \nResults suggest that poly-victimization is associated with lower mentalizing and \nhigher PTSS. Lower mentalizing, in turn, is linked to higher PTSS. Findings \nhighlight the potential of interventions fostering mentalizing in \ncare-experienced youth.\n\nPlain Language Summary: Poly-victimization among youth with care experience is \nassociated with higher rates of post-traumatic stress symptoms and lower \nmentalizing.Lower mentalizing serves as a partial mediator in the link between \npoly-victimization and post-traumatic stress symptoms.Findings underline the \npotential of interventions fostering mentalizing in care-experienced youth.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/20008066.2025.2526301\nPMID: 40677238 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n20.

LAL was lost \nwith age in mice and humans with greater losses in AD and inverse associations \nwith amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2). LAL loss preceded A\u03b2 pathology in AD mice, and neuronal LAL \nknockdown enhanced pathology and cognitive decline. In human AD brain, robust \nreductions in LAL protein were found with indications of a transcriptional \nmechanism. LAL gene therapy reduced pathology and improved cognition and affect \nin vivo.\nDISCUSSION: LAL loss is an age-related contributor to AD pathology that can be \ntargeted therapeutically.\nHIGHLIGHTS: The loss of lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) contributes to Alzheimer's \ndisease progression. LAL is lost is normal aging and Alzheimer's disease risk \nexposures. LAL loss is greater in human Alzheimer's brain and predicts the \nextent of pathology.

Radiological data were also collected from two pre-symptomatic carriers.\nRESULTS: All participants had heterozygous c.1184A\u00a0>\u00a0G, p.Asp395Gly in VCP. All \nsymptomatic cases exhibited cognitive, behavioral, and/or language dysfunction \nindicative of FTD in their 30s to 50s.

Current gold standard treatment guidelines emphasize the use \nof antipsychotic medications, though responses to these treatments vary widely, \nwith the potential for detrimental side effects. However, increasing placebo \nresponses in randomized controlled trials since the 1960s complicate the \ndevelopment of new medications. Elevated placebo responses are common in \npsychiatric populations, including those with psychosis, and are influenced by \nindividual beliefs and prior experiences. Despite extensive research on placebo \nmechanisms in conditions such as depression and pain, little is known about \nmechanisms of these effects in psychosis. This narrative review examines the \npredictors and belief formation processes underlying placebo and nocebo \nphenomena in psychosis. We discuss features of randomized controlled trials for \nantipsychotic medications, individual symptom heterogeneity, and contextual \nfactors. Findings related to placebo effects for motivation and \ncognition-enhancing drugs are also discussed. We then consider the possibility \nthat theories of predictive coding and aberrant salience provide explanation for \naspects of both placebo effects and schizophrenia spectrum symptoms. The role of \noutcome expectations broadly and in the context of reward processing is \nconsidered. We conclude with some recommendations for future placebo research in \npsychosis, emphasizing the diversity of placebo effects, assessment concerns, \ncultural considerations, and methodological aspects. Future multidisciplinary \nresearch is required to further elucidate placebo effects in schizophrenia \nspectrum disorders.\n\nDOI: 10.1017/S0033291725100901\nPMID: 40676945 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n23.

We used Mendelian randomisation (MR) to estimate the \neffect of alcohol consumption on socioeconomic and employment-related outcomes.\nMETHODS: We conducted observational analyses and two-sample MR analyses using \n230\u00a0775 working-age participants (aged 40+) of White British ethnicity/ancestry \n(54.5% male) from the UK Biobank.\nOUTCOMES: employment status (employed vs not; employed vs sickness/disability, \nunemployment, retirement or caring for home/family); weekly hours worked (among \nemployed); deprivation (Townsend Deprivation Index); highest educational \nattainment; and household income.\nEXPOSURES: alcohol consumption (units per week), hazardous alcohol consumption \nassessed by Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test-C score and Alcohol use \ndisorder (AUD).\nRESULTS: MR analyses suggested that alcohol exposure increased the risk of \nliving in a more deprived area. A unit per week increase in alcohol consumption \nincreased deprivation by 0.31 deciles (95% CI: 0.10, 0.52). A unit increase in \nliability for AUD increased deprivation by 0.09 deciles (95% CI: 0.02, 0.16). \nFindings, and often effect directions, differed by sex. In men, increased \nalcohol consumption decreased household income and increased the risk of not \nbeing in paid employment and unemployment. In women, increased alcohol \nconsumption decreased the risk of not being in paid employment, retirement, and \ncaring for home/family. Effects were generally more detrimental for men than \nwomen. This is especially evident for not being in paid employment, household \nincome, and deprivation.\nCONCLUSIONS: Alcohol consumption may increase the risk of living in deprived \nneighbourhoods. It may have deleterious effects on employment (including \nunemployment) and income, but these differ strongly by sex, largely affecting \nmen.\n\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2025.

Suicide and suicide attempts begin in \nchildren and adolescents and continue to progress, leading to serious suicide \nand suicide attempts, so early intervention is essential. This study \ninvestigated the effects of group sandplay therapy on depression, anxiety, and \nself-esteem in children at a risk of suicidal ideation.\nMETHODS: This was a non-randomized, controlled trial. After recruiting 63 \nsubjects at risk for suicidal ideation through convenience sampling based on a \npreliminary survey, the subjects were divided into a sandplay group therapy \n(SGT) group and a control group. The control group did not receive \ninterventional therapy, whereas the SGT group received 10 sessions of sandplay \ntherapy once a week, 40\u00a0min each. The clinical assessment instruments used were \nthe Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire-Junior (SIQ-JR), Center for Epidemiologic \nStudies Depression Scale for Children (CES-DC), Revised Children's Manifest \nAnxiety Scale (RCMAS), and Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale (RSES). Statistical \nanalysis was performed using IBM SPSS version 25.0, and multivariate analysis of \nvariance (MANOVA) was used.\nRESULTS: Sandplay group therapy significantly reduced depression and anxiety in \nthe SGT group at risk of suicidal thoughts compared to the control group, and \nalso significantly improved self-esteem.\nCONCLUSION: 10-week sandplay group therapy was effective in reducing depression \nand anxiety in children and improving self-esteem in children at risk of \nsuicidal thoughts. The results of these interventions, first attempted in Korea, \nsuggest that sandplay group therapy in schools can be an effective intervention \nfor children and adolescents at risk of suicide.

Although PPD's \nscreening is recommended during this period, there is few evidence about the \nassociated Risk Factors (RF) that determine this disorder in women who \nexclusively underwent an Elective Cesarean Delivery (ECD). Hence, our objective \nwas to determine the RF for PPD's positive screening in the early postoperative \nstage after an ECD.\nMETHODS: An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted in 123 women, \nrooming-in at Guadalajara's Civil Hospital Fray Antonio Alcalde, during the \naverage hospital length of stay after an ECD (2.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.02 days). To screen the \nPPD's symptomatology, we applied the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale \n(EPDS). To identify possible RF, we checked the women's sociodemographic \ncharacteristics, obstetric/pregnancy complications, and neonatal comorbidities \nin their Medical Records. Subsequently, we carried out Odds Ratio (OR) analysis, \nfollowed by logistic regression that determined adjusted OR (aOR) and 95% \nConfidence Intervals (95% CI).\nRESULTS: By applying the EPDS, we identified 32.5% of PPD's positive screening, \nassociated with miscarriages (OR 2.6, 95% CI: 1.06-6.30), and multiparity (OR \n2.6, 95% CI: 1.08-6.43) and age\u2009\u2265\u200930 years (OR 2.3, 95% CI: 1.04-5.20). Other \nassociations were with fewer prenatal visits (OR 2.4, 95% CI: 1.10-5.35), \nunplanned pregnancy (OR 2.7, 95%CI: 1.29-5.98), newborn comorbidities (OR 2.7, \n95% CI: 1.18-6.03), and obstetric complications (OR 3.1, 95% CI: 1.37-7.07). \nNevertheless, the logistic regression determined that the history of \nmiscarriages (aOR 4.8, 95% CI: 1.14-9.01), previous history of depression (aOR \n6.0, 95% CI: 1.24-10.25), obstetric complications (aOR 7.2, 95% CI: 1.40-8.41), \nand newborn comorbidities (aOR 8.1, 95% CI: 1.58-12.52) were RF for PPD.\nCONCLUSIONS: Newborn and obstetric complications, along with previous depression \nand possibly miscarriages, were main causes for the presence of depressive \nsymptoms in women with an ECD. By considering not only the latter, but also that \nthe PPD's prevalence that we found was higher than national report's results, we \nsuggest that surgical and health professionals seek these RF -Specifically \nduring this early postoperative period- in order to prevent any negative \nlong-term effects on the mother's mental well-being.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Depression is \nrecognised as a potentially reversible risk factor for low productivity in the \ngarment factory workforce. Therefore, identification and treatment of depression \nin garment factory workers can improve productivity and their quality of life in \ngeneral. The study aimed to determine the prevalence and correlates of \ndepression in garment factory workers in the Hambantota district, Sri Lanka.\nMETHODS: This is a cross-sectional descriptive study. The calculated sample size \nwas 381, and a multistage random sampling method was used. Culturally validated \nGeneral Health Questionnaire-12 and Beck Depression Inventory-II were used to \nscreen for psychological morbidity and depression, respectively.\nRESULTS: The majority of 381 employees were females (n\u2009=\u2009325, 83.3%). The mean \nage was 32.9 years (SD-10.45 years). The prevalence of depression in the study \nsample was 16.80% (95% CI: 13.04-20.55%). Depression was associated with the \npresence of a chronic medical condition (OR-3.51, 95% CI:1.61-7.67), family \nhistory of psychiatric illness (OR-3.03 95% CI-1.11 to 8.26), history of \ndeliberate self-harm (OR-10.79 95% CI-4.68 to 24.89), history of psychiatric \nillness (OR-6.12, 95% CI-2.39-15.73), and being divorced or separated from their \npartner. The only job-related factor that correlates with depression was working \nextra duty hours (OR-1.74, CI 1.01-3.02).\nCONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of depression among garment factory employees in \nHambantota district is higher than the national average. However, it is \nrelatively lower compared to garment factory populations in other developing \nAsian countries.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

This study aimed to explore \nthe network structures of depressive symptoms among Chinese middle-aged and \nolder adults before and after the COVID-19 outbreak and investigate their \nassociations with Internet use.\nMETHODS: Two cross-sectional datasets were obtained from the 2018 and 2020 waves \nof the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). Depressive \nsymptoms and Internet use were assessed using the Center for Epidemiological \nStudies-Depression Scale (CES-D) and self-reported Internet use. Network \nanalysis was conducted to identify central symptoms and differences between the \ntwo networks and their associations with Internet use.\nRESULTS: Network analysis revealed that CESD3 \"Felt depressed\" was the central \nsymptom of the depression network in both waves. No significant differences in \nnetwork structure were observed, but significant differences in global strength \nand edge strength were found. Furthermore, Internet use showed a more complex \nassociation with depressive symptoms among middle-aged and older adults in wave \n2.\nCONCLUSION: This study provides novel insights into the central features of \ndepressive symptoms among middle-aged and older adults before and after the \nCOVID-19 outbreak. Targeting interventions to central symptoms and strong edges \nmay have significant implications for depression treatment. In addition, \nstrategies aimed at enhancing Internet use guidance could potentially benefit \nthe mental health of middle-aged and older adults.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

The parent-rated Maternity-monitoring Scale by Parents (MMSP), \ndeveloped to address these gaps, was culturally adapted for China. This study \nvalidated the Chinese MMSP, offering a complementary tool to enhance PPD \ndetection through familial observations.\nMETHODS: MMSP was translated and back translated using the modified Brislin \ntranslation model, and the Chinese test version of MMSP was formed after expert \ndiscussion, cultural debugging, and pre-investigation. From September to October \n2024, convenience sampling was used to select 282 pregnant women and their \nparents from a Class A tertiary hospital in Henan Province to investigate the \nreliability and validity of the Chinese version of MMSP.\nRESULTS: The Chinese version of MMSP consists of 15 items. The correlation \ncoefficients between the scores of each item and the total score of the scale \nrange from 0.873 to 0.935 (P\u2009<\u20090.05), and the critical ratios of each item range \nfrom 12.363 to 14.758 (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Exploratory factor analysis extracted one \ncommon factor with a cumulative variance contribution rate of 82.007%. The \nscale's item-level content validity index (I-CVI) ranges from 0.83 to 1, and the \nscale's average content validity index (S-CVI/Ave) is 0.93. Using the Chinese \nversion of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale as the criterion, the \ncriterion-related validity of MMSP is 0.972 (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The Cronbach's \u03b1 \ncoefficient of the Chinese version of MMSP is 0.984, and the split-half \nreliability is 0.988.\nCONCLUSION: The Chinese version of MMSP has good reliability and validity, which \ncan be used to effectively evaluate the depression status of postpartum women in \nclinical practice and help medical staff identify and intervene in potential \ndepressive symptoms early.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Postoperatively, the revised American \nPain Society Patient Outcome Questionnaire (APS-POQ-R) was administered. \nPredictors of heightened postoperative pain were analyzed using multivariable \nlogistic regression.\nRESULTS: All 200 eligible patients participated. The median age was 55 years for \nmales and 52 years for females, with males comprising 70% of participants. Most \npatients were married (67%) and had at least 12 years of education (89%). A \nhistory of anxiety or depression was reported in 16.5% of patients, while 65.5% \nhad prior surgeries. The median preoperative HADS scores were 8 for males and 7 \nfor females (p\u2009=\u20090.1), with abnormal anxiety in 40% of males and 30% of females. \nIncreased HADS scores were significantly associated with higher postoperative \npain (B\u2009=\u20090.165, 95% CI: 0.013-0.124, p\u2009=\u20090.016). Being unmarried was also \nlinked to greater postoperative pain (B=-0.175, 95% CI: -1.215- (-0.091), \np\u2009=\u20090.023). Other demographic and clinical factors, including age, gender, BMI, \neducation, Charlson comorbidity score, and prior surgeries, were not significant \npredictors.\nCONCLUSIONS: Preoperative anxiety is a strong predictor of postoperative pain in \nurological surgeries, highlighting the need for targeted anxiety management. \nMarital status also plays a role, while other demographic and clinical variables \nshow limited predictive value.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

This study investigates the therapeutic \neffects of different visible light wavelengths (white, red, green, and blue) on \ncognitive dysfunction and oxidative stress in a chronic unpredictable mild \nstress (CUMS)-induced rat model using stressors such as cold-water swimming, \ntail pinching, food and water deprivation, cage tilting, shaking, continuous \nillumination, wet cages, heat stress, and restraint. Sixty male Wistar rats were \ndivided into control, CUMS, and light-exposure groups. The light-exposed groups \nreceived daily exposure to white (3000\u00a0lx), red (650\u00a0nm, 1300\u00a0lx), green \n(530\u00a0nm, 1300\u00a0lx), or blue (460\u00a0nm, 1300\u00a0lx) light for four hours over four \nweeks. Behavioral assessments were conducted to evaluate memory and \ndepression-like behaviors. Biochemical analyses were performed to measure \noxidative stress markers, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and serum \ncorticosterone levels. Results showed that chronic stress significantly impaired \ncognitive function, increased oxidative stress, elevated AChE activity, and \nserum corticosterone level. Red light exposure had no significant effect on any \nof the evaluated parameters. However, Light exposure, particularly blue light, \nmitigated these effects by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS), \nmalondialdehyde (MDA), and nitrite levels, while enhancing total antioxidant \ncapacity (TAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and glutathione (GSH). \nBehavioral outcomes also improved, with increased memory performance and reduced \ndepressive behaviors in light-treated groups. Histological analyses revealed \ndecreased neuronal damage in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex following \nlight therapy. These findings suggest that visible light exposure, especially \nblue light, may serve as a promising non-invasive intervention for \nstress-induced cognitive impairments by reducing oxidative stress and neuronal \ndamage.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

It has been well established that \nCHD8 has a prominent role in the development of neurons. However, there is \nlittle knowledge of its specific roles in microglia, and its possible roles in \ncellular functions after development, i.e. adulthood. In addition, while \nmicroglial dysfunction has been characterized in autism, the roles of \nautism-associated genes in microglial function have not been well characterized. \nUsing conditional knockdown technology in C57BL6 mice models, we determined that \nadulthood deletion of Chd8 in microglia induces robust changes in behavior, \nincluding anxiety, social deficits, and depression-like behavior, in association \nwith changes in microglial activation and robust microglial gene expression \nchanges in the whole brain, including expression of cytokines. Of great \ninterest, many of these changes were seen specifically in male deletion mice, \nand not female deletion mice. In contrast, adulthood neuron knockdown had more \nsubtle effects on behavior, mainly on depression-like behavior in males. In \naddition, neuronal knockdown leads to upregulation of genes associated with \nHedgehog and Wnt/Beta-catenin pathways in the hippocampus specifically in males. \nIn summary, CHD8 is particularly important for microglial function in adulthood \nand has cellular effects that are specific to males in C57BL6 mice.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Additionally, child depression is often associated with \nparallel stress and depression in parents.\nOBJECTIVE: This scenario highlights the urgent need for the development and \nimplementation of accessible and scalable solutions that may cobenefit child and \nparent mental well-being.\nMETHODS: This pilot study introduced \"Cooperative Compassion\" (CoCo), a \nparent-child cotraining digital application aimed at promoting mindfulness and \ncompassion through brief, performance-adaptive sessions. A community sample of \n24 parent-child dyads (children's mean age 9.5, SD 3.27 years; female: n=14, \nmale: n=10; Asian: n=5, White: n=11, mixed race: n=7, other race: n=1; and \nparents' mean age 44.5, SD 6.5 years; 20 female: n=20, male: n=4; Asian: n=8, \nWhite: n=14, mixed race: n=2) of high average affluence socioeconomic scores \nparticipated in the study. These parent-child dyads completed 30 sessions of \nCoCo training over 3 months with baseline and postintervention assessments \noccurring within 2 weeks of training initiation or completion, respectively.\nThe program was feasible, with 80% (n=19) of families completing over 90% (n=22) \nof sessions and providing positive feedback. Mental health assessments showed a \nnonsignificant effect in the expected direction in children's depression scores \n(Cohen d=-0.19; 95% CI -8.89 to 1.74; P=.07) and significant reductions in \nparental stress (d=-0.41; 95% CI -2.63 to -0.16; P=.02), anxiety (d=-0.47; 95% \nCI -2.67 to -0.20; P=.02), and depression (d=-0.50; 95% CI -3.25 to -0.08; \nP=.03), with sustained benefits at the 3-month follow-up. Parental mindfulness \nimprovements were correlated with stress reduction (\u03c1=-0.45; P=.03). On an \nemotion bias task used as an objective assessment of cognition, children \ndemonstrated improved processing speed after the intervention (d=0.54; 95% CI \n0.012-0.083; P=.005), and a marginal improvement was also observed in parents \n(d=0.19; 95% CI -0.004 to 0.030; P=.05). Cortical source imaging of \nelectroencephalographic recordings was acquired simultaneous to an \nattention-to-breathing assessment that showed significant reduction in \ntask-related default mode network activity (d=-0.62; 95% CI -0.0096 to -0.0002; \nP=.01).\nCONCLUSIONS: Post-CoCo intervention decrease in default mode network activity on \nthe attention-to-breath task in parent-child dyads may be indicative of cortical \nplasticity reflecting reduced mind-wandering and thereby, enhanced focus after \ntraining. The current promising behavioral and cognitive results suggest the \nneed for a larger sample size and a randomized controlled study design. Overall, \nthese findings highlight the potential for brief, digital mindfulness and \ncompassion cotraining to improve family mental health and well-being.\n\n\u00a9 Satish Jaiswal, Jason Nan, Seth Dizon, Jessica O Young, Suzanna R Purpura, \nJames K Manchanda, Dhakshin Ramanathan, Dennis J Kuo, Jyoti Mishra.

While digital \ninterventions offer promise for managing these chronic conditions (such as via \nlifestyle modification), there is also emerging evidence suggesting that digital \nsupport may strengthen or complement existing health care relationships, \nparticularly by improving patient perceptions of communication and connection \nwith their health care providers.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the impact of an adaptive mobile health \n(mHealth) texting-based intervention on patient ratings of communication with \ntheir health care providers among individuals with diabetes and depressive \nsymptoms.\nMETHODS: This study used data from the DIAMANTE (Diabetes and Mental Health \nAdaptive Notification Tracking and Evaluation) trial, a prospective, randomized \ncontrolled trial that varied SMS text messaging strategies to encourage physical \nactivity to support both mental and physical health for patients with diabetes \nand depression. Patients were recruited from safety-net clinics in San Francisco \nand through social media during the COVID-19 pandemic, and were randomized into \nthree trial arms: (1) personalized SMS text messaging about physical activity \nvia an adaptive learning algorithm, (2) randomly selected SMS text messaging \nabout physical activity, and (3) a control group that received no SMS text \nmessages. As a secondary outcome, we examined pre-post changes in \npatient-reported health care communication, assessed via surveys with the \nvalidated Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) \ncommunication subscale. Bivariate comparisons examined changes in CAHPS scores, \nincluding age, gender, preferred language, race or ethnicity, nativity, marital \nstatus, and education. Our primary analysis used mixed-effects modeling within \nan intent-to-treat analysis to determine differences in CAHPS scores by trial \narm.\nRESULTS: A total of 195 patients participated in the DIAMANTE trial from 2020 to \n2022. After excluding patients who had incomplete or missing baseline or exit \nsurveys, 156 patients were included in this secondary analysis. Overall, there \nwas a substantive but nonsignificant decrease in the average CAHPS score over \nthe 6-month trial period (-2.6; P=.11), with similar trends across patient \ndemographic subgroups. Upon evaluating health care communication across the \nthree randomized controlled trial (RCT) arms, there were no significant \ndifferences in patient-provider communication.\nCONCLUSIONS: Digital health interventions are rapidly increasing in clinical \npractice and have the ability to reach historically underserved communities by \novercoming barriers such as language, geography, and time constraints. However, \nRCTs have primarily focused on the clinical impact of these tools, rather than \nhow the tools may impact patients' perceptions of their relationships with \nproviders. While our study found no significant changes in patient-provider \ncommunication by RCT arm, the temporal implications of the COVID-19 pandemic \nduring the DIAMANTE study period remain unclear and should be further studied. \nThis study is the first of its kind to examine the influence of an adaptive \nmHealth intervention on patient-reported health care communication, with \ninsights that may be important as digitally-enabled chronic care management \nrapidly expands.\n\n\u00a9 Lynn Leng, Marvyn R Ar\u00e9valo Avalos, Adrian Aguilera, Courtney R Lyles. \nOriginally published in JMIR mHealth and uHealth (https://mhealth.jmir.org).\n\nDOI: 10.2196/64296\nPMID: 40674692 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n34.

Repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation (rPMS) is \npotentially effective in treating CPPS, while repetitive transcranial magnetic \nstimulation (rTMS) has demonstrated therapeutic effects on anxiety and \ndepression. Therefore, the study proposed herein aims to assess the efficacy and \nsafety of dual-target magnetic stimulation in CPPS patients with psychological \ndisorders.\nMETHODS: This prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial will \nrecruit 75 CPPS participants. After stratification by sex, participants will be \nrandomly assigned via block randomization (1:1:1), sequentially based on \nenrollment order, to one of three groups: dual-target magnetic stimulation (rPMS \nand rTMS), rPMS, and sham stimulation, all receiving standard treatment. The \ndual-site magnetic stimulation group will receive left dorsolateral prefrontal \ncortex (DLPFC) rTMS (120% resting motor threshold [RMT], 10 Hz, 4-s stimulation, \n26-s interval, 3000 pulses in total [depression cases]) or right DLPFC rTMS \n(120% RMT, 1 Hz, 10-s stimulation, 2-s interval, 1000 pulses in total [anxiety \ncases]) combined with rPMS (50% of maximum stimulation intensity, 20 Hz, 2-s \nstimulation, 28-s interval, 1600 pulses in total). The rPMS group will receive \nonly rPMS. The sham stimulation group will undergo sham transcranial and \nperipheral stimulation. All treatments will be administered five times a week, \nonce daily, for 4 weeks. Primary outcomes will be the pelvic pain scale \n(females) or the National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index \n(NIH-CPSI, males). Secondary outcomes will include assessment of pelvic floor \nmuscle surface electromyography, pudendal nerve motor evoked potentials, the \nDepression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and the Short Form 36 (SF-36) \nquality of life scale.\nDISCUSSION: We hypothesize that dual-target magnetic stimulation will show \ngreater effectiveness than rPMS and sham stimulation in relieving pain symptoms \nand psychological distress in CPPS patients with comorbid mental disorders.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was prospectively registered at the \nChinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR; http://www.chictr.org.cn, ID: \nChiCTR2300078761) on December 18, 2023; Protocol version 1.0-20220709.\n\nCopyright: \u00a9 2025 Luo et al.

The \npresent study assessed the correlation between depression and the medical \nexpenditures of patients with heart disease, highlighting the importance of \nmental health care for patients with with heart disease.\nMETHOD: Using data from Charles, we identified 2445 middle-aged and older \npatients with heart disease based on their completed medical expenditure-related \nquestionnaires. The study further calculated the questionnaire data and used \nmultiple linear regression analysis to control for demographic variables to \nevaluate the relationship between depressive symptoms and medical expenses.\nRESULTS: In our sample, the presence or absence of depressive symptoms exhibited \nstatistically significant differences (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in the medical expenditures of \npatients. Approximately 50.27% of heart disease patients had depressive \nsymptoms. Depression level, gender, education level, type of health insurance, \nconsumption level, and number of other chronic diseases were significantly \nassociated with higher medical expenditures. A positive correlation was found \nbetween depressive symptoms and medical expenses.\nCONCLUSION: Heart disease patients exhibiting depressive symptoms incurred \nhigher medical expenditures compared to their counterparts without depression. \nThe findings of this study imply the need to augment mental health care services \nfor older individuals with heart disease and to enhance collaborative care \ninterventions within the context of heart disease.\n\nCopyright: \u00a9 2025 You et al.

The existence of equilibrium points and their corresponding stability \nare analyzed under certain conditions to explore the system's dynamics. The \noccurrence of a Hopf bifurcation, a saddle-node bifurcation, and a \nBogdanov-Takens bifurcation are confirmed. The partial rank correlation \ncoefficient method is performed for the sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, the \ncross-diffusion is incorporated in the formulated model system to identify the \nspatio-temporal dynamics of the system. All theoretical results are validated \nthrough a numerical simulation. The outcome of the temporal model shows a \ndecrease in the fear effect due to the predation by the red fox helps to \nincrease the quokka population. The spatio-temporal model indicates that as the \ndiffusion coefficient and fear parameters vary, the pattern changes from \nisolated spots to stripes, and again from stripes to spots. This represents the \nvariation in spatial interactions and aggregation. The dispersion of predators \nand prey increases with an increased diffusion; however, the group formation is \nrestricted by a stronger fear effect that scatters prey.\n\nDOI: 10.3934/mbe.2025050\nPMID: 40676976 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n37.

The effects of these \nearthquakes are particularly deeply felt among younger generations and trigger \nvarious psychological factors. Therefore, the aim of this study is to measure \nthe levels of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), social phobia (SP), \ngeneralized anxiety disorder (GAD), and depression on separation anxiety \ndisorder (SAD) among adolescent earthquake survivors affected by the \nKahramanmaras Earthquakes (2023).\nMETHODS: In the study, the data were obtained using a survey method. A total of \n605 adolescent earthquake survivors exposed to the Kahramanmaras earthquakes \nwere reached. The research was analyzed using structural equation modeling \n(SEM).\nRESULTS: Surprisingly, according to the research findings, there was no \nsignificant and positive relationship between SP (\u03b2 = -0.006, P > 0.05) and \nDepression (\u03b2 = -0.117, P > 0.05) on SAD.\nCONCLUSIONS: Consequently, while PTSD and GAD had significant and positive \neffects on SAD in those adolescent earthquake survivors affected by the \nKahramanmaras Earthquakes (2023), SP and Depression did not have significant and \npositive effects on SAD. Therefore, it is recommended that future studies \nexamine the effects of SP and Depression on SAD more comprehensively and in \ndetail through qualitative research.\n\nDOI: 10.1017/dmp.2025.10123\nPMID: 40671298 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n38.

Love addiction \n(LA) is characterised by an overwhelming investment in romantic relationships, \nresulting in excessive dependence on the partner, expressed through obsessive \nbehaviours and beliefs. Although current literature suggests that LA may best \nfit within the behavioural addictions diagnostic cluster, several authors \nemphasise the relational nature of the disorder. We conducted two moderation \nanalyses to examine associations with LA. In Study 1, we tested the moderation \nrole of attachment (ECR-SF) in the relationship between obsessive-compulsive \ndisorder (ROCI) and LA (assessed by the LAI). In Study 2, we explored the \nmoderating role of dyadic emotion dysregulation (DDY) in the relationship \nbetween self-defeating tendencies (SELF-DISS) and LA. Study 1 involved a sample \nof 720 adults, and Study 2 included 672 adults. A significant and positive \ninteraction was found between anxious attachment and relational \nobsessive-compulsive disorder (Study 1) as well as between self-defeating and \ndyadic emotion dysregulation (Study 2) in their associations with Love \nAddiction. These preliminary findings contribute to the current understanding of \nLove Addiction, highlighting the significant role of relational dimensions in \nits development.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

Though IS has been studied \nin specific medical groups, no review to date compares findings across groups. \nThis study aimed to: (1) determine the range of IS rates among medical \nundergraduates versus postgraduates and (2) examine associated factors across \nboth groups.\nDESIGN: This scoping review used the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for \nscoping reviews, using a five-step framework.\nDATA SOURCES: PubMed, Scopus and PsycINFO databases were searched from inception \nuntil September 2024.\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies were included if they were (1) empirical studies \nwith a defined IS rating scale, (2) involving medical undergraduates, residents \nor clinicians and (3) published in English.\nDATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Three independent reviewers used standardised \nmethods to screen and review selected studies, and extract key variables.\nRESULTS: 54 studies (77.8% from the West) were included. There was equal study \ndistribution between undergraduates (46.3%, 25 studies) and postgraduates \n(46.3%, 25 studies), with the rest covering both groups. IS prevalence was \nsubstantial across all groups when assessed using the Clance Impostor Phenomenon \nScale, ranging from 30.6% to 75.9% among undergraduates, 33.0% to 75.0% among \nresidents and 23.5% to 50.0% among faculty and clinicians. In undergraduates, IS \nwas associated with learning breaks, transition periods and poor academic \nperformance. Among postgraduates, IS was correlated with younger age, junior \nranking, fewer work years, inadequate faculty support or self-perceived poor \nclinical and teaching skills. Additionally, IS affected physical and \npsychological well-being (stress, anxiety, depression, burnout) and was \nassociated with sociodemographic factors (single status, females), personality \n(neuroticism, perfectionistic traits, with conscientiousness, agreeableness and \nextraversion as protective) and interpersonal issues (conflicts, poor sense of \nbelonging).\nCONCLUSIONS: Given the high IS prevalence and associations with specific \nfactors, practical measures are recommended to address IS and optimise learning \nand care for medical undergraduates and professionals.\n\n\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

A systematic review \nand meta-analysis.\n\nIvan L(1), Foerster P(1), Bermpohl FMG(2), Gerlach AL(1), Pohl A(1).\n\nAuthor information:\n(1)Department of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, University of Cologne, \nCologne, Germany.\n(2)Department of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, University of Wuppertal, \nWuppertal, Germany.\n\nOBJECTIVE: The purpose of this meta-analysis is to give an overview of the \nrelationships between positive and negative metacognitions (PMC, NMC) with \nhealth anxiety and pathological safety seeking and avoidant behavior (SSB, AB).\nMETHOD: The preregistered systematic literature screening included following \ndata bases: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX, PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Web of \nScience, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses, and The German National Library. The \nstudies were evaluated based on predefined eligibility criteria (i.e., data for \nPMC/NMC and health anxiety and/ or SSB/AB from adult samples, assessed with \nvalidated inventories and presented in English or German language) and risk of \nbias categories. Correlation coefficients were aggregated with random effect \nmodels. Publication biases were estimated with contour enhanced funnel plots and \noutlier analyses.\nRESULTS: 23 studies (N\u2009=\u20099229) were included in the meta-analysis. Most studies \nassessed health anxiety in analogue samples. A significant medium effect was \nfound for PMC and health anxiety (r\u2009=\u2009.36, p\u2009<\u20090.0001, 95% CI:.29\u2009\u2264\u2009r\u2009\u2264\u2009.43), \nwhereas for NMC the effect was large (r\u2009=\u2009.52, p\u2009<\u20090.0001, 95% \nCI:.46\u2009\u2264\u2009r\u2009\u2264\u2009.58). For the relationship with SSB the results revealed a moderate \neffect for PMC (r\u2009=\u20090.31, p\u2009=\u2009.004; 95%-CI: 0.19\u2009\u2264\u2009r\u2009\u2264\u20090.42) and a small effect \nfor NMC (r\u2009=\u2009.25, p\u2009=\u2009.02, 95% CI:.05\u2009\u2264\u2009r\u2009\u2264\u2009.43). No study assessed AB.\nDISCUSSION: Metacognitions are a significant pathological factor in health \nanxiety, with particularly strong association with NMC. PMC might be of special \ninterest for health anxiety and SSB compared to other psychopathologies. \nHeterogeneity, missing clinical samples and studies on AB limit \ngeneralizability. Future research should further explore the role of \nmetacognitions in health anxiety and focus on the relation with pathological SSB \nand AB.\n\nCopyright: \u00a9 2025 Ivan et al.

Studying the factors associated with the co-occurrence of mental \nhealth problems could contribute to the development of preventive and \ntherapeutic interventions.\nAIM: To describe the co-occurrence of depressive symptoms, generalized anxiety \nsymptoms, and problematic substance use among university students, and to \nanalyze the relationship between sociodemographic factors and the presence of \nco-occurring mental health problems.\nMETHOD: A total of 1,470 university students (53.8% female; mean age 19.6) \ncompleted self-report questionnaires on depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), generalized \nanxiety symptoms (GAD-7), and substance use risk (ASSIST). Data were analyzed \nusing bivariate hypothesis testing and logistic regression models.\nRESULTS: Among the students, 69.6% reported moderate to severe depressive \nsymptoms, 46.9% moderate to severe generalized anxiety symptoms, and 52.5% \nsubstance use risk. A total of 58.6% screened positive for two or more mental \nhealth problems. High co-occurrence was observed (between 56.0% and 93.9%, \np<0.05) among depressive symptoms, generalized anxiety symptoms, and problematic \nsubstance use risk. Female students, non-heterosexual individuals, those from \nlow and middle socioeconomic backgrounds, and those simultaneously studying and \nworking were more likely to experience co-occurring mental health problems (OR \n\u22651.08; p \u22640.024).\nCONCLUSION: A high percentage of students scored above clinically relevant cut \npoints for mental health, with high co-occurrence of depressive symptoms, \ngeneralized anxiety symptoms, and risky substance use. Various factors were \nsignificantly associated with the presence of co-occurring mental health \nproblems. Based on these findings, it is recommended to consider the \nco-occurrence of mental health problems in the diagnosis, treatment, and \nprevention of mental health issues during university years.\n\nDOI: 10.4067/s0034-98872025000700505\nPMID: 40668017 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n42.

The current study \ntherefore aimed to explore the relationship of EMSs with symptom severity and \nsubtypes in patients with TTM and SPD, as well as to compare their baseline EMS \nlevels to those of a group of patients with obsessive\u2012compulsive disorder (OCD).\nMETHODS: The Young Schema Questionnaire-Short Form (YSQ-SF), along with measures \nof disorder-specific symptoms and subtypes, was administered to patients with \nTTM (n\u2009=\u2009120), SPD (n\u2009=\u200975), and OCD (n\u2009=\u200988) prior to treatment. Potential \nbetween-group differences in EMSs were explored with ANCOVA, with age and \nillness duration as covariates. Disorder- and subtype-specific patterns were \nexplored with correlational analysis.\nRESULTS: No significant baseline differences in EMS severity were found between \nTTM, SPD, and OCD patients, thereby corroborating EMSs' transdiagnostic function \nin mental disorders. Several EMSs were significantly positively associated with \nself-reported and clinician-rated symptoms and picking/pulling styles of TTM and \nSPD, with some indications of diagnosis-specific association patterns.\nCONCLUSION: These results suggest that EMSs are common among individuals with \nTTM and SPD and that assessment of these schemas may enhance clinicians' \nunderstanding of TTM and SPD patients' presenting problems.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

However, despite high efficacy and efficiency, dissemination \nof exposure-based treatments is limited. Important factors that contribute to \nthis limited dissemination are negative beliefs about exposure on the part of \nthe public, the therapists, and the patients. While patients perceive exposure \ntherapy as burdensome, therapists are concerned about putting too much strain on \ntheir patients during exposure, leading to suboptimal delivery of exposure. In a \nprevious study, in which healthy participants underwent a differential fear \nconditioning paradigm, we found initial evidence that the integration of a \ntherapy dog into exposure reduces participants' anxiety and increases \nparticipants' positive affect without causing poor treatment outcome. Thus, the \nintegration of a therapy dog into exposure might be a promising approach to \naddress patients' and therapists' concerns and, thus, to (1) foster \ndissemination of exposure that is (2) delivered in an optimal manner. To \nscrutinise our findings in a clinical sample, we designed the present study. We \ntest the following hypotheses: (H1) participants in the dog group report \nsignificantly less anxiety during the course of the treatment than participants \nin the control group. (H2) Participants in the dog group report significantly \nmore positive affect during the course of the treatment than participants in the \ncontrol group. (H3) Participants in the dog group report significantly higher \ntherapy motivation than participants in the control group. (H4) Participants in \nthe dog group report significantly lower anticipatory anxiety than participants \nin the control group. (H5) The treatment in the dog group is not inferior to the \ntreatment in the control group.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this parallel randomised controlled trial of two \ngroups, n=88 participants (spider phobics without: a current diagnosis of a \nmental disorder other than a specific phobia, insect bite allergy, dog hair \nallergy, fear of dogs, current psychopharmacological treatment, and current \npsychotherapeutic treatment; the sample size calculation is based on the results \nfrom our previous study) are randomly allocated (with a 1:1 allocation as per a \ncomputer-generated randomisation schedule) to either an ambulant one-session in \nvivo exposure treatment of spider phobia with a therapy dog (dog group) or \nwithout a dog (control group). Due to the nature of the intervention, neither \nparticipants nor therapists can be blinded once participants are allocated to \none of the two groups. However, the person conducting screening and diagnostics \nis blind to the allocation, participants are blind to the hypotheses and the \nrespective other group, and the researchers are blind to the allocation while \nanalysing the data. We will test (H1) and (H2), concerned with our primary \noutcomes, by means of 2\u00d74 mixed analyses of variance with the between-subjects \nfactor group (dog group vs. control group), the within-subjects factor time \n(with four levels, one for each time point anxiety and affect are measured \nduring treatment), and anxiety or positive affect as the dependent variable, \nrespectively. We will test (H3) and (H4) by means of an analyses of covariance \nwith therapy motivation/anticipatory anxiety at baseline as the covariate, the \nbetween-subjects factor group (dog group vs. control group) and therapy \nmotivation/anticipatory anxiety at pre-treatment as the dependent variable, \nrespectively. We will test (H5) by means of 95% CIs and non-inferiority zones.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial was approved by our university's ethics \ncommittee (reference number 24-11). Any deviations from this study protocol or \nthe preregistrations as well as any adverse events potentially arising in the \ncourse of the trial, will be made explicit in the publication of the trial \nresults.

The control group (146 patients, 48% male, mean \nage 48.7\u2005\u00b1\u200512.9) received the same MR examination condition and only received \nroutine psychological intervention. Before the intervention, after MR \nexamination, all patients were required to complete the Claustrophobia \nquestionnaire, hospital anxiety and depression scale, and the Connor-Davidson \nresilience scale questionnaire. Additionally, the occurrence of claustrophobic \nevents, image quality, patient satisfaction, average completion time, and 1-time \npass rate were recorded. Claustrophobia events included premature termination, \nsedation, and non-sedation coping actions. The Shapiro-Wilk test was employed to \nassess the normality of the data, while either an independent samples t test or \nMann-Whitney U test was utilized to analyze differences in quantitative \ninformation between the 2 groups. \u03c72 test was employed to validate the \nqualitative data.\nRESULTS: The prevalence of claustrophobia was significantly reduced in the \nintervention group compared with the control group (18%, 14/77 vs 46%, 67/146; \nP\u2005<\u2005.05), while the need for sedation (3%, 2/77 vs 10%, 15/146; P\u2005<\u2005.05) and \nnon-sedation coping actions (12%, 9/77 vs 23%, 33/146; P\u2005<\u2005.05) was also \nsignificantly reduced in patients who received SFBT & MBSR interventions. \nPatients who received the SFBT & MBSR intervention had lower mean examination \ncompletion time (17.28\u2005\u00b1\u20053.36 vs 19.75\u2005\u00b1\u20054.23; P\u2005<\u2005.05), and hospital anxiety \nand depression scale score (from 9.03\u2005\u00b1\u20050.9 to 6.30\u2005\u00b1\u20050.8; 6.30\u2005\u00b1\u20050.8 vs \n9.08\u2005\u00b1\u20051.0; P\u2005<\u2005.05), higher 1-time pass rate (82% vs 61%; P\u2005<\u2005.05), image \nquality (P\u2005<\u2005.05), examination satisfaction (P\u2005<\u2005.05), and Connor-Davidson \nresilience scale score (from 57.73\u2005\u00b1\u20054.5 to 66.08\u2005\u00b1\u20054.7; 66.08\u2005\u00b1\u20054.7 vs \n57.78\u2005\u00b1\u20054.6; P\u2005<\u2005.05). However, there was no statistically significant change \nobserved in the Claustrophobia questionnaire for either the intervention or \ncontrol group.\nCONCLUSION: The intervention model combining SFBT with MBSR may substantially \nreduce the incidence of claustrophobia in high-risk patients during MR \nexaminations and may reduce the need for sedation and non-sedation coping \nactions.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 the Author(s).

It is increasingly \nprevalent among healthcare professionals due to their high reliance on mobile \ntechnology. However, limited data exist regarding the prevalence and severity of \nnomophobia, specifically among physiotherapists in Saudi Arabia. The Nomophobia \nQuestionnaire (NMP-Q) was administered via SurveyMonkey, targeting a convenience \nsample of physiotherapists between April 30 and June 27, 2023. Data were \nanalyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics, Version 28.0. Categorical variables were \nsummarized using frequencies and percentages. The Kruskal-Wallis H and \nMann-Whitney U tests were employed to compare median NMP-Q scores across \nparticipant subgroups. A total of 1003 physiotherapists participated, with 579 \n(57.7%) females. The prevalence of nomophobia was 99.6%. The Kruskal-Wallis Test \nshowed that the age group 51-60 years had the highest NMP-Q scores (Md\u2009=\u200999, x2 \n(4, N\u2009=\u20091003)\u2009=\u200957.31, p\u2009<\u2009.001) in comparison to other age groups. The female \ngroup was higher in total scores on the NMP-Q questionnaire (Md\u2009=\u200994, x2 (1, \nN\u2009=\u20091003)\u2009=\u200925.41, p\u2009<\u2009.001) compared to the male group (Md\u2009=\u200987, x2 (1, \nN\u2009=\u20091003)\u2009=\u200925.41, p\u2009<\u2009.001). Physiotherapists with clinical experience between \n16 and 20 years and night shift workers were the highest in total scores on the \nNMP-Q questionnaire (Md\u2009=\u200996, x2\u2009=\u200962.87; Md\u2009=\u200994, x2\u2009=\u200936.79, p\u2009<\u2009.001, \nrespectively) compared to other groups with different levels of clinical \nexperience and shift patterns. Being divorced, a current smoker, and living with \nroommates were highly scored levels of nomophobia compared with categorized \nsub-groups. Nomophobia is highly prevalent among physiotherapists, with most \nreporting moderate levels. Interventions to promote balanced mobile phone use \nand digital well-being are recommended to improve mental health, job \nsatisfaction, and productivity, fostering a healthier work environment.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

A CT scan of the abdomen was \nperformed with a surprising cause of the trouble - a trichobezoar filling the \nstomach, also described as Rapunzel syndrome, i.e. Goldilocks syndrome. Upon \nfurther questioning, the patient's mother retrospectively admits her daughter's \npulling out her own hair (trichotillomania) and eating it (trichophagia) since \nthe age of four. The finding was consulted, and could not be removed by \ngastroscopy due to its size. A successful laparoscopic gastrotomy with total \nextraction of the trichobezoar was performed. The child recovered without \ncomplications. A psychiatric evaluation was performed and the child was \ndischarged home on the 10th postoperative day.\n\nDOI: 10.48095/ccrvch2025165\nPMID: 40659520 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n47.

Mobile health \n(mHealth) interventions offer anonymity, accessibility, and personalized \nsupport, but their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness for young individuals \nwith social anxiety remain unclear.\nOBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness \nand cost-effectiveness of a mobile-based psychoeducation program (OkeyMind) for \nmitigating social anxiety symptoms among youth.\nMETHODS: Participants aged 15 years through 24 years with mild or more severe \nsocial phobia (Social Phobia Inventory [SPIN] \u226525) and access to WeChat will be \nrecruited and screened onsite and then randomly assigned to the intervention or \nwaiting list control group. The study will recruit 180 participants, with 90 in \neach group. The intervention group will receive a 1-month mobile psychoeducation \nprogram (OkeyMind), which includes both psychoeducation and meditation \ncomponents, with all content fully automated. The waiting list control group \nwill receive the same intervention after 3 months. The primary outcome is social \nanxiety symptoms measured using SPIN. Secondary outcomes include depression \n(Patient Health Questionnaire-9) and health-related quality of life (EuroQol-5). \nAssessments will be conducted at baseline, postintervention, and a 3-month \nfollow-up.\nRESULTS: Recruitment began in September 2024. The study was funded in April \n2024, and the first participant was enrolled in September 2024; as of the end of \nMarch 2025, 132 participants had been recruited. Recruitment is ongoing. Data \ncollection will conclude in July 2025, after which data analysis will begin and \nbe completed in August 2025, with primary findings targeted for publication in \nspring 2026.\nCONCLUSIONS: This research evaluates the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of \nOkeyMind, a mobile-based psychoeducation program, for reducing social anxiety \nsymptoms among youth. OkeyMind might be a promising strategy for combating \nsocial anxiety, especially in low- and middle-income countries with limited \nmedical resources. If effective, this intervention could provide an accessible, \ncost-effective approach to managing social anxiety, particularly in \nresource-limited settings.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06490315; \nhttps://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06490315.\nINTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): PRR1-10.2196/64518.\n\n\u00a9Yi-Zhou Wang, De-Hui Ruth Zhou, Siu-Man Ng, Bei-Bei Wang, Yu-Ya Feng, Xue Weng. \nOriginally published in JMIR Research Protocols \n(https://www.researchprotocols.org), 14.07.2025.\n\nDOI: 10.2196/64518\nPMID: 40658950 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"}
