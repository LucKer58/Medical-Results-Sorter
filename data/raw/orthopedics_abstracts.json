It has overwhelmed orthopedic care at Al-Aqsa \nMartyrs' Hospital, the only public hospital serving the middle region of the \nGaza Strip. With over a million displaced individuals and a sharp rise in \nwar-related injuries, the department has been operating under extreme \nconstraints, including shortages of medical supplies, staff, and infrastructure. \nThe orthopedic department, initially small and under-equipped, has rapidly \nexpanded and adapted to handle mass casualties. This has involved restructuring \nstaff shifts, implementing a three-team 24-h rotation system, and repurposing \nexisting facilities to accommodate the influx of patients. Emergency care \nevolved around a fluidic triage system, and surgical capacity was extremely \nstrained. The repurposed obstetrics and gynecology theaters and delivery rooms \nbecame primary operating rooms, with two-thirds of all surgeries being \northopedic-related. Innovative solutions, such as field hospitals and tents for \ndressing, have helped alleviate some of the pressure. The introduction of the \nDressing Under General Anesthesia (DUGA) system has improved wound care for \nsevere injuries. International collaboration, particularly with M\u00e9decins Sans \nFronti\u00e8res (MSF) and other NGOs, has played a critical role in supplementing \nmedical services and expertise, providing medical and surgical supplies, and \nfacilitating certain procedures. Despite these adaptations, the department \nremains overwhelmed. Resource limitations have caused delays in essential \nprocedures, leading to complications such as non-union fractures and infections. \nAdditionally, coordination between local and international teams has been \nchallenging, underscoring the need for a more structured response to improve \nefficiency. The study highlights the adaptation and resilience of the orthopedic \ndepartment at Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Hospital. It underscores the urgent need for \npolicy reforms to enhance emergency preparedness, expand surgical capacity, and \ndevelop a sustainable, resilient healthcare system. Key recommendations include \nstandardizing clinical protocols, strengthening supply chains, and supporting \noverburdened and burnout medical staff. Addressing these challenges is crucial \nto sustaining orthopedic care in Gaza's war-torn healthcare system.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Alamrain, Halimy, Toman, Kassab, Alkhaldi, Alderdasawe, \nAbuaita, Alzayyan, Tahir and Harb.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fpubh.2025.1595477\nPMCID: PMC12263624\nPMID: 40672908 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n3.

Private R&D funding was \nobtained from the top five orthopedic companies by revenue and compared to net \nsales to calculate R&D as a percentage of total sales. Annually reported \nfinancial statements from Securities Exchange Commission filings were used. \nPrivate funding was summed annually and compared to National Institute of \nArthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases spending using descriptive \nstatistics.\nRESULTS: Annual research funding from the top five orthopedic companies is 10.0 \ntimes that of the NIH, an increase from 9.2 times in 2017. The top five \ncompanies spent a mean of 7.2% of their net sales on R&D. Overall, $7.7 billion \nis allocated to MSK research annually, with only 9.1% from public sources.\nCONCLUSION: Given this disparity, efforts should assess public investment in \northopedic research while recognizing the critical role of industry in funding \nmusculoskeletal research.

The lack of female representation \nin orthopaedic surgery has been attributed to a variety of factors, including \nthe absence of female mentors and leaders within the field. As such, we sought \nto examine the gender diversity among orthopaedic surgery faculty in various \nsubspecialties at academic institutions and the distribution of female faculty \nin positions of leadership.\nMETHODS: The American Medical Association Fellowship and Residency Electronic \nInteractive Database (FREIDA) was used to identify all allopathic orthopaedic \nsurgery residency programs during the 2022 to 2023 academic year. The total \nnumber of faculty, and distribution of female faculty by subspecialty were \ncollected from January to March 2023. The mean and percentage of female faculty \nin each subspecialty per program was calculated.\nRESULTS: The total number of orthopaedic surgery female faculty identified was \n524. The subspecialty with the highest percentage of female faculty per program \nwas pediatrics at 26.1% (148/511). Hand (18.6%; 113/511), oncology (19.2%; \n38/511), foot and ankle (13.6%; 49/511), spine (3.9%; 21/511), shoulder and \nelbow (7.4%; 7/511) and adult reconstruction (3.7%; 24/511) had lower \npercentages of female faculty per program. A total of 52 (10.2%) female section \nchiefs were identified across all programs. Oncology had the highest percentage \nof female faculty represented in section leadership at 18.4% (7) and sports \nmedicine had the lowest at 4.8% (4).\nCONCLUSION: Gender diversity of faculty in orthopaedic surgery is low with adult \nreconstruction (3.7%), spine (3.9%), and shoulder and elbow (7.4%) having the \nlowest percentages of female faculty. The percentage of female faculty \nrepresented in section leadership is also lacking with a total of 52 (10.2%) \nfemale section chiefs identified across all programs. Increasing the number of \nfemales in leadership positions across all orthopaedic subspecialties may be one \nstep in helping improve gender diversity in the field.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

In prior studies, researchers have \ndemonstrated different applications, from radiographic assessment to bone tumor \ndiagnosis. The purpose of this review is to analyze the current literature on AI \nand deep learning tools to identify the most used tools in the risk assessment, \noutcome assessment, imaging, and basic science fields.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: searches were conducted in PubMed, EMBASE and Google \nScholar from January 2020 up to October 31st, 2023. We identified 862 studies, \n595 of which were included in the systematic review. A total of 281 studies \nabout radiographic assessment, 102 about spine-oriented surgery, 95 about \noutcome assessment, 84 about fundamental AI orthopedic education, and 33 basic \nscience applications were included. Primary outcomes were diagnostic accuracy, \nstudy design and reporting standards reported in the literature. Estimates were \npooled using random effects meta-analysis.\nRESULTS: 53 different imaging methods were used to measure radiographic aspects. \nA total of 185 different machine learning algorithms were used, with the \nconvolutional neural network architecture being the most common (73%). To \nimprove diagnostic accuracy and speed were the most commonly achieved results \n(62%).\nCONCLUSION: heterogeneity was high among the studies, and extensive variation in \nmethodology, terminology and outcome measures was noted. This can lead to an \noverestimation of the diagnostic accuracy of DL algorithms for medical imaging. \nThere is an immediate need for the development of artificial \nintelligence-specific guidelines to provide guidance around key issues in this \nfield.\n\nPublisher: INTRODUCCI\u00d3N: la inteligencia artificial (IA) y deep learning en \nortopedia han ganado un gran inter\u00e9s en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os.

Uncemented fixation has become increasingly prevalent, while cemented \nfixation remains more common for older patients. This study aimed to (1) compare \nfemoral fixation in patients aged \u2264 75 versus > 75 years, performed by surgeons \nseeking initial board certification or recertification through the American \nBoard of Orthopaedic Surgery and (2) determine the probability of increased \ncemented femoral fixation in patients beyond the age of 75 years.\nMETHODS: In 2022 and 2023, a total of 35,068 primary THA cases were submitted to \nthe American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery Case List system, with 20,075 cases \nfrom recertification candidates and 14,993 cases from initial certification \ncandidates. The mean patient age was 66 years, with a women's representation of \n54%. Statistical analyses were used Chi-square and t-tests with Bonferroni \ncorrections.\nRESULTS: Significant differences in fixation techniques were observed between \nsurgeon groups, with Part II candidates using more hybrid fixation (8 versus 3%) \nand less uncemented fixation (89 versus 93%) compared to the recertification \ngroup (all P < 0.001). This trend was evident in older patient age groups (> 75 \nyears). In addition, the difference in fixation techniques between patients aged \n\u2264 75 years and those > 75 years was statistically significant (all P < 0.001). \nThe proportion of older patients (> 75 years) receiving cemented/hybrid fixation \nincreased progressively with advancing age, 21% in > 75 years, 30% in those > 80 \nyears, and 41% in those > 85 years.\nCONCLUSIONS: There were significant differences in THA fixation based on patient \nage. In addition, significant differences existed between Part II and \nrecertification candidates in their use of hybrid and uncemented fixation for \nolder patients. As patient age exceeded 75 years, the likelihood of \ncemented/hybrid fixation increased; however, even in patients over 85 years, its \nuse remained less than 50%.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

With the United States Medical Licensing Examination Step \n1 examination now pass/fail, research experience and publications have become \nincreasingly important for applicants. This study explores key aspects of \northopaedic surgery research fellowships for medical students including the \naverage number of publications and presentations, additional learning \nopportunities, and total number of fellows who matched into an orthopaedic \nsurgery residency after their research year.\nMETHODS: Research year fellowships were identified through an online search \nusing publicly available information and the search terms \"Orthopaedic Research \nFellowship\" and \"Orthopaedic Research Gap Year\" in May 2024. If available, \ninformation from individual program websites was used. Programs were contacted \nto provide the number of publications, presentations, and clinical opportunities \noffered by the program and the number of previous research fellows matched.\nRESULTS: In total, 130 orthopaedic research year fellowship programs were \nidentified. Information was collected for 80 programs through survey response or \npublicly available information. The average number of fellowship-related \npublications was 11.7 (range 2 to 30) and presentations was 11.86 (range 1 to \n60). In addition, 68 programs offered additional opportunities including \nclinical and operating room exposure, educational experiences, and mentorship. \nThe total number of research fellows from each program who matched into \northopaedic surgery ranged from 0 to 30.\nCONCLUSION: This study found that orthopaedic research fellowships offer medical \nstudents an average of 11.7 publications and 11.86 presentations, along with \nnotable clinical exposure. This study offers insights into key characteristics \nof research fellowships for students evaluating programs, while also \nhighlighting the need for future research to determine which applicants benefit \nmost and how the role of these fellowships is changing in light of the pass/fail \nUnited States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 examination.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 The Authors.

However, their presence in surgical specialties, \nparticularly in orthopedic surgery, remains disproportionately low. This study \ninvestigates gender discrimination and disparities in Italian orthopedic \nresidency programs, expanding on existing literature, which indicates that \nfemale surgeons worldwide face challenges such as fewer promotions, lower \nsalaries, and higher rates of harassment.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: From June to August 2024, the SIAGASCOT Junior Committee \nconducted a voluntary and anonymous survey among registered male and female \northopedic residents. The survey was distributed via email and social media and \nincluded 23 questions covering demographics, training opportunities, perceptions \nof gender discrimination, and experiences of physical or verbal harassment. \nStatistical analyses were performed using the Chi-squared test and Mann-Whitney \nU test to compare gender-based differences.\nRESULTS: A total of 394 residents were invited to participate in the survey, and \n81 residents participated: 46 women (56.8%), 34 men (42%), and 1 respondent who \npreferred not to disclose his or her gender (response rate: 20.5%). While no \nsignificant gender disparities were observed in access to training \nopportunities, such as international experiences or professional memberships, \nsignificant gender differences emerged in perceptions of discrimination. \nNotably, 84.8% of female respondents reported being considered \"unsuitable\" for \northopedic surgery solely owing to their gender, compared with 0% of male \nrespondents (p\u2009<\u20090.01). In addition, 85% of women reported experiencing verbal \nor physical harassment, primarily from male superiors or patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the persistence of gender disparities in \northopedic surgery, with notable differences in perceived discrimination and \nharassment experiences between male and female residents. Although training \nopportunities appear to be equally distributed, the reported gender disparities \nseem to arise from subjective perceptions and cultural attitudes rather than \nmeasurable differences. Addressing these disparities requires cultural shifts, \nmentorship programs, and institutional policies aimed at eliminating harassment \nand promoting equity, ultimately fostering a more inclusive and supportive \nenvironment in orthopedic surgery.\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

We assessed whether the spectrum of skin color depicted in \northopedic literature appropriately reflects the population and whether that \nrepresentation has changed over time.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined images of human patients published in four \njournals: Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery (JBJS), Clinical Orthopaedics and \nRelated Research (CORR), Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons \n(JAAOS), and The American Journal of Sports Medicine (AJSM) in 2010 and 2020. \nFitzpatrick skin phototypes were used to categorize images as \"lighter skin \ntone\" (types I-III) or \"darker skin tone\" (types IV-VI), with the latter \nattributed to Black, Asian, Native American, and multiracial individuals. We \ncompared published skin tones to 2020 United States census data (38% of the \npopulation being Fitzpatrick types IV-VI) using chi-square analysis.\nRESULTS: Of 649 eligible images, 13% depicted Fitzpatrick skin types IV-VI. \nThere was no significant change from 2010 to 2020 (11% vs 16%, P=0.07) in \ndepictions of Fitzpatrick types IV and above. Darker skin tones were \nunderrepresented compared to the US population (13% vs 38%, P<0.001). In \nUS-based articles representation increased from 11% to 18% (P=0.045), but no \nchange was observed in non-US articles (12% vs 12%, P=0.9).\nCONCLUSION: While there has been a mild improvement over time in the diversity \nof skin colors represented, the depiction of darker skin types in orthopedic \nliterature still falls well short of that seen in the general population. \n[Orthopedics. 2025;48(4):197-202.].\n\nDOI: 10.3928/01477447-20250610-01\nPMID: 40607751 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Disclosure: RWL has received royalties from \nOrthopediatrics, paid to Case Western Reserve University; is a University \nHospitals Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) Chair; is the Pediatric \nOrthopaedic Society of North America (POSNA) Evidence Based Practice Committee \nChair; and is the Deputy Editor, Hip and Lower Extremity of Journal of Pediatric \nOrthopaedics.

Antibiotic therapy was gradually modified and lasted \na total of 164 days. Ultimately, the combination of fosfomycin and \nflucloxacillin administered over a period of 62 days led to resolution of psoas \nabscesses and normalization of spinal findings on magnetic resonance imaging. \nThis case highlights the potential of fosfomycin as part of combination therapy \nfor difficult-to-treat or recurrent vertebral infections caused by \nStaphylococcus aureus, particularly in patients with underlying HIV infection.\n\nPMID: 40678882 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n14.

No published studies address the cost-benefit of PF.\nOBJECTIVES: Observe the association between PF and intervertebral disc (IVD) \nsurvival and conduct cost-benefit analysis.\nANIMALS: Eighty chondrodystrophic dogs with recurrent IVDE.\nMETHODS: Longitudinal assessment with follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) \nwas performed to retrospectively observe the survival of in\u00a0situ IVDs. The \nassociation between PF and IVD survival was analyzed using a multivariable \nsurvival model, which included Pfirrmann grade as a covariate. Worst-case, \nbase-case, and best-case cost-benefit simulations were conducted, corresponding \nto the lower 95% confidence interval (CI), point estimate, and upper 95% CI of \nthe effect size of PF.\nRESULTS: For IVDs treated with PF, 4/31 (12.9%) IVDs were documented to \nsubsequently extrude on follow-up MRI. For IVDs not treated with PF, 76/602 \n(12.6%) were documented to subsequently extrude on follow-up MRI. There was no \nassociation between the use of PF and IVD survival (time ratio: 1.17; 95% CI: \n0.49-2.76; p\u2009=\u20090.72). An increase in Pfirrmann grade was associated with a \ndecrease in IVD survival (time ratio: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.26-0.46; p\u2009<\u20090.001). \nProphylactic fenestration was only cost-effective under a limited range of \nconditions.\nCONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: There was no evidence that PF prevented \nIVDE under study conditions. Pfirrmann grade was the strongest predictor of IVD \nsurvival. Universal use of PF was not cost-effective in multiple simulations. \nTargeted PF of high-risk IVDs may be considered the most cost-effective \napproach.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

The joinpoint regression analysis model was employed to assess temporal \ntrends, and the average annual percent change (AAPC) was calculated to summarize \nthe trends over the study period.\nRESULTS: Globally, the number of incident childhood cases of MNBAC increased \nfrom 9,827 in 1990 to 12,294 in 2021, with an AAPC of 0.38. Similarly, the \nprevalence of the disease also increased, with an AAPC of 0.39. However, the \nmortality rate and DALYs rate showed a slight decline, with an AAPC of -0.16 and \n-0.16 respectively. At the national level, the United States had the highest \nincidence and prevalence rates, while India had the highest number of incident \ncases and DALYs. China showed the largest increase in prevalence, with an AAPC \nof 1.88. India also demonstrated the most significant decline in mortality and \nDALYs rates. Additionally, the mortality rate and DALYs rate were slightly \nhigher for male children compared to female patients.\nCONCLUSION: Malignant bone and articular cartilage tumors in children remain a \nsignificant public health challenge globally. By strengthening monitoring, \nincreasing investment in medical resources, promoting early screening and \nintervention, and enhancing international cooperation and exchange, we hope to \nfurther reduce the burden of childhood bone cancer and improve children's \nquality of life and health standards.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Li and Yuan.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fpubh.2025.1481304\nPMCID: PMC12267175\nPMID: 40678654 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n16.

The metastatic process is \ndriven by complex biological mechanisms, including tumor cell-specific \nadaptations of growth pathways, immune modulation within the tumor \nmicroenvironment, and reactivation of metastatic cells from dormancy. This \nscoping review captures overlooked and under researched pathways, supporting \nmainstream therapeutic targets while shedding light on novel ones, reinforcing \nand revising conclusions drawn in previous literature, and guiding future \nresearch. MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched with a publication \ndate limit from 2019 onwards using relevant MeSH terms combined with Boolean \noperators, truncations, and keyword searches. The search culminated in 43 \nreports, including 30 in vivo, 8 in vitro, and 5 observational studies. This \nstudy conforms to the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Tumor cell adaptations, including \nepithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhanced migratory and proliferative \nsignaling via JAK/STAT and TGF-\u03b2 pathways, are critical drivers of OS lung \nmetastasis. Manipulated upstream ligand-driven signaling promotes \ntranscriptional changes that increase cell cycle proteins and mesenchymal \nmarkers, conferring chemoresistance and advancing OS cells toward a metastatic \nstate. The tumor microenvironment also plays a key role; interactions between OS \ncell-derived cytokines and tumor-infiltrating immune cells lead to tumor \nassociated macrophages and neutrophils (TAMs/TANs), which help establish a \npre-metastatic niche and provoke immune remodeling. However, the impact of TAMs \non OS survival remains ambiguous due to their dual pro- and anti-tumor roles. \nLung-induced dormancy links tumor intrinsic and immune-driven mechanisms, \nallowing tumor cells to evade immunity or pause progression. Inflammatory \npathways and immune activation can reverse dormancy, promoting further OS \ndissemination. The reviewed evidence supports targeting intracellular signaling \nand immune pathways to mitigate OS metastasis. The paucity of longitudinal data \non lung dormancy warrants caution, emphasizing integrated approaches and better \ncontrolled studies with focus on combinatorial therapies for more conclusive \noutcomes.\n\nDOI: 10.1177/15330338251359716\nPMID: 40676851 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe authors \ndeclared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, \nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\n\n17.

Dual sensory defects, \nseveral metabolic and hormonal dysfunctions are frequent in ALMS. Increased \nmusculoskeletal deformities have been observed, though these aspects have not \nbeen systematically reviewed. This study characterises the anthropometric, \nclinical, genetic and imaging features of bone deformities in a large UK cohort \nwith ALMS and describes the details of first documented successful corrective \nsurgery for scoliosis.\nMETHODS: A preliminary study of 13 Alstr\u00f6m patients was\u00a0undertaken to evaluate \nmusculoskeletal deformities. Written consent was obtained after sharing of study \ninformation via voice mail or Braille. Questionnaires, clinical examination and \nradiological evaluations were\u00a0conducted\u00a0twice 12\u00a0months apart by a \nrheumatologist and an\u00a0orthopaedic surgeon. Two patients had scoliosis which \nrequired intervention. To discover its prevalence, 42 further AS patients were \nreviewed. All patients attended the Alstom syndrome UK specialist clinics.\nRESULTS: In the detailed survey of 13 patients, all had some degree of \nmusculoskeletal deformities, most commonly partially correctable thoracic \nkyphosis, brachydactyly, femoral anteversion and pes planus but rarely affecting \ntheir daily functioning. In the larger group of 55 patients, 6 had scoliosis \nrequiring intervention; two of whom had spinal deformity requiring surgical \ncorrection in adolescence, and one had cervical spine surgery for spondylitis.\nCONCLUSION: ALMS patients tend to have high prevalence of musculoskeletal \ndeformities which may be part of the ciliopathy. Postural adaptation to dual \nsensory loss resulted in correctable kyphosis, treatable by physiotherapy. \nScoliosis requiring intervention is frequent (10.9%), with successful surgery \nundertaken where indicated.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

However, few studies have \ninvestigated the relationship between computed tomography (CT)-based \nquantitative analysis of bone microarchitecture and the prognosis of rotator \ncuff healing.\nMETHODS: An OP rat model was established via bilateral ovariectomy combined with \ndexamethasone administration. A full-thickness supraspinatus tear was surgically \ninduced, followed by an 8-week intervention with either alendronate (ALN) or \nsaline. Non-osteoporotic rats served as control group. Histological analysis and \nbiomechanical testing were performed to evaluate tendon-to-bone healing. \nAdditionally, quantitative micro-CT analysis of the humeral greater tuberosity \nwas conducted, and correlations with tendon healing outcomes were assessed.\nRESULTS: Histological analysis at 8 weeks revealed disorganized structure and \npoor fibrovascular tissue in the OP group, while the OP\u2009+\u2009ALN group exhibited \nimproved tendon-bone healing with better collagen fiber alignment and higher \nhistological scores. A decreased RANKL/OPG ratio suggested that ALN treatment \nmodulated regional bone metabolism in the humeral greater tuberosity. The \nYoung's modulus was reduced in both osteoporotic groups compared to the Control \ngroup. Although the difference between the OP and OP\u2009+\u2009ALN groups was not \nstatistically significant, a trend was observed: 50% of specimens in the OP \ngroup failed at the tendon-bone interface, compared to 33.3% in the OP\u2009+\u2009ALN \ngroup. CT analysis demonstrated that ALN treatment improved bone \nmicroarchitecture. Notably, bone microarchitectural parameters significantly \ncorrelated with histological scores of tendon healing.\nCONCLUSION: Tendon-bone healing is impaired in the presence of OP but can be \npartially restored by ALN treatment. Furthermore, CT-based quantitative analysis \nof bone microarchitecture at the humeral greater tuberosity shows a significant \ncorrelation with rotator cuff healing. These results imply that such analysis \nmight serve as a potential indicator of postoperative prognosis.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Until 2021, there were no precision treatments available, \nand in some countries, elective surgery was considered a standard approach to \nincrease height, improve body proportions, enhance functionality, and correct \ndeformities in a selected group of patients. Recently, C-type natriuretic \npeptide (CNP) has been explored as a potential treatment, aiming to counteract \nthe molecular activity driven by FGFR3. Although post-market and real-world data \non the drug are still limited, many questions remain about the potential for \ncombining pharmacological and surgical therapies and how this might influence \npatient outcomes. Concerns have also been raised regarding the potential impact \nof drugs on bone healing. However, anecdotal evidence from orthopaedic practice \nsuggests that the two ossification processes do not interfere with one another. \nThe aim of this study was to describe the first real-world case series in which \nvosoritide treatment was integrated with limb surgery in children and \nadolescents with achondroplasia.\nRESULTS: Sixteen paediatric patients with molecular confirmation of \nachondroplasia were included in the study. All patients underwent combined \nvosoritide therapy and limb surgeries (13 for lower limb lengthening and 3 for \nvarus correction through epiphysiodesis).The complementary roles of vosoritide \ntherapy and surgery were highlighted, with treatment outcomes aligning closely \nwith expectations.\nCONCLUSION: This report provides the first clinical description of the \ncombination of precision therapy with limb surgery in a relatively large \nmulticentre cohort of paediatric patients with achondroplasia. These findings \nsupport continued exploration of the integration of different therapeutic \napproaches.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Bone turnover markers, including \nparathyroid hormone, C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen, and N-terminal \npropeptide of type I procollagen, all exhibit distinct diurnal variations. \nTeriparatide, a recombinant parathyroid hormone analog, demonstrates \ntime-dependent efficacy influenced by these endogenous rhythms. However, the \nimpact of administration timing on bone metabolism remains underexplored.\nOBJECTIVE: This randomized, open-label, exploratory trial investigates the \nimpact of teriparatide administration timing by comparing subcutaneous injection \nat 08:00 versus 20:00 on bone turnover markers in postmenopausal women with \nosteoporosis.\nMETHODS: Twenty-eight participants (aged 60-70 years, lumbar spine T-score \u2264 \n-3.0) will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 20\u00a0\u00b5g/day of teriparatide via \nsubcutaneous injection at either 08:00 or 20:00 for 12 weeks. All participants \nwill receive standardized calcium (1000-1500\u00a0mg/day) and cholecalciferol \n(800-1200 IU/day) supplementation throughout the study period. The primary \noutcomes are the between-group differences in serum parathyroid hormone, \nC-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen, and N-terminal propeptide of type I \nprocollagen profiles, which will be assessed at baseline, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks. \nSecondary outcomes will evaluate the safety profile during the trial.\nDISCUSSION: This trial is expected to provide crucial insights into optimizing \nteriparatide administration timing, potentially guiding personalized dosing \nstrategies to enhance bone formation and reduce fracture risk in osteoporosis. \nThe findings may inform future research on circadian rhythm-aligned therapies.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT06951776.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Thus, opportunistic screening may be \na cost-effective way to assess osteoporosis in high-risk populations.\nBACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is an underdiagnosed condition associated with \nfractures and frailty, but may be detected in routine computed tomography (CT) \nscans.\nMETHODS: Volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) was measured in clinical routine \nthoraco-abdominal CT scans of 207 patients for planning of transcatheter aortic \nvalve replacement (TAVR) using an artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithm.\nRESULTS: 43% of patients had osteoporosis (vBMD\u2009<\u200980 mg/cm3 L1-L3) and were \nelderly (83.0 {interquartile range [IQR]: 78.0-85.5} vs. 79.0 {IQR: 71.8-84.0} \nyears, p\u2009<\u20090.001), more often female (55.1 vs. 28.8%, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and had a \nhigher Society of Thoracic Surgeon's score for mortality (3.0 {IQR:1.8-4.6} vs. \n2.1 {IQR: 1.4-3.2}%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). In addition to lumbar vBMD (58.2\u2009\u00b1\u200914.7 vs. \n106\u2009\u00b1\u200921.4 mg/cm3, p\u2009<\u20090.001), thoracic vBMD (79.5\u2009\u00b1\u200917.9 vs. 127.4\u2009\u00b1\u200926.0 \nmg/cm3, p\u2009<\u20090.001) was also significantly reduced in these patients and showed \nhigh diagnostic accuracy for osteoporosis\u00a0assessment (area under curve: 0.96, \np\u2009<\u20090.001). Osteoporotic patients were significantly more often at risk for \nfalls (40.4 vs. 22.9%, p\u2009=\u20090.007) and required help in activities of daily life \n(ADL) more frequently (48.3 vs. 33.1%, p\u2009=\u20090.026), while direct-to-home \ndischarges were fewer (88.8 vs. 96.6%, p\u2009=\u20090.026). In-hospital bleeding \ncomplications (3.4 vs. 5.1%), stroke (1.1 vs. 2.5%), and death (1.1 vs. 0.8%) \nwere equally low, while in-hospital device success was equally high (94.4 vs. \n94.9%, p\u2009>\u20090.05 for all comparisons). However, one-year probability of survival \nwas significantly lower (84.0 vs. 98.2%, log-rank p\u2009<\u20090.01).\nCONCLUSION: Applying an AI-based algorithm to TAVR planning CT scans can reveal \na high rate of 43% patients having osteoporosis.

There are few studies on the relationship \nbetween NHHR and bone mineral density (BMD). This study aimed to investigate the \ncorrelation between the NHHR and BMD. Weighted multiple linear regression, \nthreshold effects, and fitted smoothed-curve modeling were employed in this \ncross-sectional analysis, which comprised 3,138 participants in the 2011-2018 \nNHANES, to examine the relationship between NHHR and BMD. A total of 3,138 \nparticipants were analyzed and grouped by NHHR quartiles. Higher NHHR was \nassociated with male gender, younger age, and increased cardiometabolic risk \nfactors. NHHR was negatively correlated with BMD, and a significant non-linear \nrelationship was observed, with an inflection point at 1.301. Below this \nthreshold, NHHR was significantly inversely associated with BMD. Subgroup \nanalyses revealed stronger associations in participants\u2009<\u200920 years and females. \nThese findings suggest NHHR may be an independent biomarker for BMD, \nparticularly in youth and women, offering insights into lipid-bone metabolism \ncross-talk.

Interactome mapping, gene enrichment \nprofiling, target gene expression assessment, and molecular docking coupled with \ndynamics simulations were performed to elucidate the mechanistic basis of UA \naction. For experimental studies, UA was synthesized and its effects on \nosteosarcoma cell viability, apoptosis, migration, adhesion, invasion, and MMP \nactivity were evaluated using alamarBlue assay, flow cytometry, scratch assay, \nfibronectin-based adhesion assay, Boyden chamber assay, and gelatin zymography, \nrespectively. Results identified AKT1, EGFR, and MMP9 as potential targets of UA \nassociated with osteosarcoma progression. Further analyses revealed critical \ninteractions among these hub targets, with significant upregulation of AKT1 \nobserved in osteosarcoma tissue samples. Molecular docking and dynamics \nsimulations demonstrated strong and stable binding of UA to the kinase domain of \nAKT1 and the active site of EGFR. Experimental validation showed that treatment \nwith UA significantly inhibited the migration and invasion of osteosarcoma \ncells, while notably enhancing cell adhesion. This anti-metastatic effect was \nclosely linked to a marked reduction in enzymatic activity of MMP2 and MMP9, key \nmediators of metastatic dissemination. These findings position UA as a promising \ntherapeutic candidate for targeting osteosarcoma metastasis.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Despite advances in treatment, finding a \ncure or preventing disease progression remains a major clinical challenge, \nunderscoring the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. Among various \npathways involved in the pathophysiology of RA, the mitogen-activated protein \nkinases/extracellular regulated protein kinases (MAPK/ERK) pathway is of \nparticular importance. As the central cascade within the broader MAPK signaling \npathways, MAPK/ERK plays a critical role in regulating numerous physiological \nand pathological processes, with a well-established and prominent involvement in \nRA. Unlike p38 MAPK and c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), whose role in RA have \nbeen well-documented, the specific contributions of the MAPK/ERK pathway to RA \nremains comprehensively unreviewed. Furthermore, the MAPK/ERK pathway does not \nact in isolation but interacts synergistically with other major pathways, \nincluding NF-\u03baB, Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription \n(JAK/STAT), sonic hedgehog (SHH), and PI3K/AKT, which further enhance its \npathological effects. This review offers a comprehensive analysis of MAPK/ERK \nsignaling pathway, focusing on its molecular components and its contribution to \nRA pathophysiology. Furthermore, we explore the cross-talk between MAPK/ERK and \nother pathways in the context of RA, and evaluates the therapeutic potential of \ntargeting this pathway with small molecule inhibitors, natural compounds and \nbiomolecules. By elucidating the mechanistic role of MAPK/ERK in RA, this \narticle aims to highlight the pathway's therapeutic relevance and provide a \nfoundation for the developing more effective, targeted therapies for RA.\n\n\u00a9 2025 Xie et al.\n\nDOI: 10.7717/peerj.19708\nPMCID: PMC12269783\nPMID: 40677749 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that they have no competing \ninterests.\n\n\n25.

Disease \nremission was determined using disease activity scales. Sustained remission was \ndefined as at least two consecutive visits in remission within the first 12 \nmonths of follow-up. Multivariate Cox regression was used to compare the \nprobability of achieving remission between ETA-B and ETA-O, and multivariate \nlogistic regression was used to assess sustained remission.\nRESULTS: We studied 150 participants with RA (ETA-B: 65.3%). Among 125 \nparticipants not in remission at baseline, the median time to first remission \nwas 8.7 months (95% confidence intervals [CI] 5.2-12.1) in the ETA-B group and \n14.5 months (95% CI 4.7-18.6) in the ETA-O group. Time to first remission was \nsimilar between the groups (log-rank test: P-value\u2009=\u20090.51). Multivariate Cox \nregression showed no clear difference in first remission between ETA-B and ETA-O \n(adjusted hazard ratio 1.52, 95% CI 0.68-3.39). Among 125 participants with at \nleast 12 months of follow-up, the prevalence of sustained remission was 19.5% \nfor ETA-B and 21.0% for ETA-O. In multivariate analysis, we did not detect a \nsignificant difference in sustained remission between ETA-B and ETA-O (adjusted \nodds ratio 1.14, 95% CI 0.29-4.87).\nCONCLUSION: We did not detect clear differences in first remission and sustained \nremission between participants with RA initiating ETA-B or ETA-O.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Not applicable.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Although joint stiffness can be restored by surgical \ninterventions such as adhesion lysis, arthroscopic debridement, and capsular \nrelease, arthrofibrosis tends to redevelop in the months following the surgery. \nThus, there is a critical and urgent need to develop a non-invasive, \npharmacological therapy to prevent or resolve arthrofibrosis. A subclass of \nsmall extracellular vesicles called exosomes convey bioactive regulators like \nmicro ribonucleic acids (miRNAs/miRs), which can function as anti- and \npro-fibrotic agents. Currently, there is no research on miRNA-based therapeutic \npotentials for treating arthrofibrosis. Previous research and clinical \nobservations on fibrosis across organ systems suggest that there are \ncommonalities in pathogenic mechanisms that can be targeted in arthrofibrosis \ntherapy. In this study, we collated and critically analyzed the existing \nliterature on exosomal miRNAs in organ fibrosis to discover potential candidates \nfor diagnosing, preventing, and/or treating arthrofibrosis. Fifty-six articles \nwere finally selected and categorized by anti- and pro-fibrotic candidates of \nmiRNAs. Notably, let-7, miR-26, miR-29, miR-146, miR-148/-152, miR-214, miR-223, \nand miR-21 emerged as prominent candidates that should be investigated further \nfor effectiveness in arthrofibrosis therapy.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

The outcomes of interest were visual analog scale (VAS), knee function \nscores, radiological results, and complication rates. Case-control studies were \nassessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale, and randomized controlled trials were \nindependently evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration's assessment tool. \nHeterogeneity was tested using I\u00b2, and a fixed or random-effects model was \nselected for meta-analysis based on the heterogeneity results. Of the 21 studies \nincluded, 17 were case-control studies and 4 were RCTs.\nRESULTS: A total of 21 studies, including 1006 knees, were included in the \nmeta-analysis. PFO can effectively alleviate the most troubling pain for \npatients (VAS: mean difference MD = -4.25 [-5.51; -3.00]) and significantly \nimprove postoperative knee function (Hedges' g\u2009=\u20092.41 [1.35-3.47]). Moreover, \ndue to the minimal surgical trauma, the incidence of postoperative complications \nis low, with sensory abnormalities of the common peroneal nerve being the most \ncommon adverse event (5.93%; 95% CI: 2.15-11.25%), followed by common peroneal \nnerve palsy (2.25%; 95% CI: 0.14-6.14%), fracture (0.56%; 95% CI: 0-1.74%), and \nonly two cases of infection were reported in all included studies, both of which \nrecovered within half a year. In addition, PFO can effectively improve the \nradiological outcomes, with an increase in HKA (MD\u2009=\u20091.73 [0.33; 3.13]), a \ndecrease in FTA (MD = -3.83 [-4.05; -3.62]), an increase in knee joint space \n(MD\u2009=\u20092.66\u00a0mm[2.38; 2.94]), and an increase in the ratio of medial to lateral \nknee joint space (MD\u2009=\u20090.16 [0.15; 0.18]).\nCONCLUSION: In the field of MKOA treatment, PFO has shown a promising prospect. \nThe clinical function scores and radiological assessments improved after PFO in \nthis meta-analysis, indicating that this surgical method can significantly \nimprove patients' symptoms, correct the varus deformity of the lower limb \nalignment, and is safe. However, it must be pointed out that the quality of \nevidence supporting this conclusion is still low, and radiological studies are \nrelatively few. Therefore, future studies need to be conducted in more diverse \npatient populations, incorporating more radiological indicators and providing \nhigher-quality clinical evidence.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Hand sarcopenia in RA leads to functional deterioration and diminished \nquality of life. Although conventional methods, such as exercise and nutrition, \nare typically used, current evidence suggests that massage therapy may offer \nadvantages through anti-inflammatory, circulatory, and anabolic pathways. This \nhypothesis-driven article proposes that targeted hand massage may alleviate \nsarcopenia in RA by enhancing local perfusion, modulating immunological \nresponses, mitigating oxidative stress, and stimulating muscle-regenerative \npathways. Experimental investigations in animals and humans have demonstrated \nthat massage can activate mechanotransduction signaling, enhance muscle protein \nsynthesis, stimulate satellite cell activity, and reduce inflammatory mediators, \nincluding tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6. Moreover, enhancements \nin handgrip strength and muscle oxygenation have been documented after \nmechanical interventions. Small sample sizes, diverse methodologies, and the \nabsence of standardized massage procedures limit the clinical validity of the \ndata. Randomized controlled trials involving RA patients with compromised hand \nfunction and sarcopenia are necessary to explore this hypothesis. Standardized \noutcome measures, such as handgrip strength, disease activity scores, muscle \ntissue imaging, and inflammatory biomarkers, are required to assess efficacy. If \nverified, massage therapy may provide a non-invasive, low-risk complement to \nestablished care, potentially enhancing muscle function and quality of life in \nRA patients with sarcopenia.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

While probiotics have shown anti-inflammatory \npotential in preclinical studies, their therapeutic role in OA has not been well \nestablished in human research. This exploratory randomized controlled trial \n(RCT) aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Latilactobacillus sakei \nLB-P12 in improving knee OA symptoms. In this randomized, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled trial, 100 participants aged 40-75\u00a0years with chronic knee \npain were assigned to receive either LB-P12 (350\u00a0mg/day, 10 billion CFU) or \nplacebo for 12\u00a0weeks. The primary outcome was the change in Western Ontario and \nMcMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scores. Secondary outcomes \nincluded visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain, inflammatory markers (CRP, \nESR, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1), cartilage degradation biomarkers (COMP), joint space \nwidth, and health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L). Safety was evaluated using \nlaboratory tests and vital signs. After 12\u00a0weeks, the LB-P12 group showed \nsignificantly greater improvements in WOMAC total scores and VAS pain scores \ncompared to the placebo group. All three WOMAC subdomains-pain, stiffness, and \nphysical function-showed consistent reductions. Inflammatory cytokines, \nparticularly IL-1\u03b2, were significantly reduced in the LB-P12 group. Quality of \nlife also improved significantly. No adverse events or clinically meaningful \nabnormalities in laboratory values were observed. This exploratory RCT suggests \nthat daily supplementation with LB-P12 is safe and may offer potential benefits \nin reducing knee pain and improving physical function and quality of life in \nindividuals with knee OA. Further large-scale and long-term RCTs are needed to \nconfirm these findings and elucidate the underlying mechanisms.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

While gene therapy offers \na promising therapeutic approach, its effectiveness is limited by the challenges \nof non-specific gene expression in healthy tissues. Here, we develop a gene \ndelivery system (namely APPC), in which near-infrared (NIR)-responsive gold \nnanorods are coated with chondroitin sulfate-modified polyethyleneimine to \nfacilitate the heat-responsive targeted delivery of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) \ngene. The APPC shows favorable transfection efficiency due to its targeting \nability and significantly facilitates HO-1 expression under NIR irradiation. The \ncombination of APPC/pHO-1 and NIR can effectively reprogram the cellular \nmetabolism and repolarize the macrophages and fibroblast-like synoviocytes, \nthereby inhibiting inflammation by suppressing glycolysis. Meanwhile, APPC can \nspecifically enhance the HO-1 expression in inflamed tissues through \nNIR-mediated the activation of heat shock protein 70 promoter, ensuring the \nprecise gene expression via photothermal conversion. In a collagen-induced \narthritis model, APPC/pHO-1 under NIR irradiation exhibits potent therapeutic \nefficacy, restoring the articular microenvironmental homeostasis and mitigating \nthe symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.

The \ntotal proportion of children with carditis was 61%. Australian compared with New \nZealand participants more commonly had ARF recurrence (22% vs 0%), underlying \nRHD (48% vs 0%), possible/probable ARF (23% vs 9%) and were underweight (64% vs \n16%). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) provided an incremental diagnostic \nyield of 21% compared with C reactive protein. No instances of RHD were \ndiagnosed among participants in New Zealand. Positive throat Group A \nStreptococcus culture was more common in New Zealand than in Australian \nparticipants (69% vs 3%). Children often required prolonged hospitalisation, \nwith median hospital length-of-stay being 7\u2009days (range 2-66). Significant \npredictors for length of stay in a multivariable regression model were valve \ndisease (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.56, 95%\u2009CI 1.23 to 1.98, p<0.001), requirement for \ncorticosteroids (aOR 1.99, 95%\u2009CI 1.22 to 3.26, p=0.007) and higher ESR (aOR \n1.4, 95%\u2009CI 1.17 to 1.67, p<0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: This study provides new knowledge on ARF characteristics and \nmanagement and highlights international variation in diagnostic and management \npractice. Differing approaches need to be aligned. Meanwhile, locally specific \ninformation can help guide patient expectations after ARF diagnosis.\n\n\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

This study aims to \ninvestigate the effects of augmentation choices, including bone grafts, cement, \nand intramedullary plates, in locking plate fixation for proximal humerus \nfractures.\nMETHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched\u00a0for studies up to \nApril 2024. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed within a frequentist \nframework.\nRESULTS: A total of 35 studies, comprising 6 randomized controlled trials and 29 \nnonrandomized studies of intervention with a total of 37,494 patients, were \nincluded in this review. After adjusting for small-study bias, locking plate \nfixation with bone grafts or cement did not affect overall complication risk \n(risk ratio [RR]: 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-1.45), the screw \nprotrusion risk (RR: 0.74, 95% CI 0.45-1.13), and the avascular necrosis risk \n(RR: 0.98, 95% CI 0.73-1.32) compared with locking plates alone. Augmentation \nshowed small-to-moderate effects on pain reduction and functional improvement \nand reduced changes in humeral head height and neck-shaft angle. In subgroup \nanalyses, cement augmentation, while possibly inferior to bone grafts in pain \nrelief and function, showed comparable effects on radiographic outcomes. No \nsignificant difference between strut fibular and non-fibular grafts was \nobserved.\nCONCLUSIONS: Augmentation with bone grafts or cement does not convincingly \nreduce complication risks or screw protrusion compared with locking plate \nfixation alone. However, it improves pain, function, and radiographic outcomes \nin osteosynthesis of proximal humerus fractures.\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II.\nREGISTRATION: CRD42024500403.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

However, evidence for \nthis approach in osteoporotic hip fracture patients remains limited. This study \naimed to evaluate the effectiveness of sequential therapy using short-term \nanabolic agents followed by antiresorptive treatment on bone mineral density \n(BMD) and bone turnover markers (BTMs) in patients with osteoporotic hip \nfractures.\nMETHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 330 patients with osteoporotic hip \nfractures between February 2022 and December 2023 and selected 113 patients. The \npatients were categorized into a sequential group (n\u2009=\u200968), who received an \nanabolic agent (teriparatide or romosozumab) for three to six months, followed \nby two doses of denosumab administered at six-month intervals, and a \nnon-sequential group (n\u2009=\u200945), who received anabolic agent monotherapy. The \nprimary outcome was mean change in BMD at the lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck \n(FN), and total hip (TH) at one-year postoperatively. Secondary outcomes were \nthe osteoporosis medication profile and mean change of 25-hydroxyvitamin D\u2083 \n(25(OH)D\u2083) and BTMs including C-terminal telopeptide (CTX) and procollagen type \n1\u00a0N-terminal propeptide (P1NP).\nRESULTS: The sequential group showed significant increases in LS-, FN-, and \nTH-BMD at one-year follow-up (3.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.7%, 4.4\u2009\u00b1\u20097.9%, and 1.9\u2009\u00b1\u20094.1%, \nrespectively; p\u2009<\u20090.001 for all). In contrast, the non-sequential group showed \nnon-significant changes in BMD at all sites. In the sequential group, CTX levels \ndecreased significantly (0.57\u2009\u00b1\u20090.39 to 0.32\u2009\u00b1\u20090.30 ng/ml, p\u2009<\u20090.001), whereas \nthe non-sequential group showed a non-significant increase in CTX levels \n(0.73\u2009\u00b1\u20090.47 to 0.90\u2009\u00b1\u20090.56 ng/ml, p\u2009=\u20090.44). P1NP levels decreased \nsignificantly in the sequential group (88.2\u2009\u00b1\u200965.7 to 66.2\u2009\u00b1\u200962.8\u00a0\u00b5g/L, \np\u2009<\u20090.001). The 25(OH)D\u2083 levels improved in both groups but were higher in the \nsequential group (20.7\u2009\u00b1\u200911.1 to 37.2\u2009\u00b1\u200913.6 ng/mL).\nCONCLUSION: Sequential therapy with short-term anabolic agents followed by \nantiresorptive therapy significantly improved BMD and normalized BTMs in \npatients with osteoporotic hip fractures. This treatment approach may be an \neffective strategy to enhance bone health and potentially reduce subsequent \nfracture risk in this high-risk population.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Databases including \nPubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Scopus were searched until June 9, 2025. Study \nselection, data extraction, and quality assessment were independently performed \nby two reviewers. Statistical analyses were conducted using STATA version 18.0. \nDichotomous outcomes were expressed as risk ratios (RR) or odds ratios (OR), and \ncontinuous outcomes as weighted mean differences (WMD) or standardized mean \ndifferences (SMD), each with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Heterogeneity was \nassessed using I\u00b2 statistic and Cochran's Q test, applying a random-effects \nmodel if I\u00b2 >50% or p\u2009<\u20090.1. Publication bias was evaluated via funnel plots and \nEgger's regression test.\nRESULTS: Eleven studies comprising 829 patients (409 IMN; 420 MIPO) met the \ninclusion criteria. The IMN group demonstrated a significantly lower infection \nrate compared with the MIPO group (RR\u2009=\u20090.55; 95% CI, 0.33-0.91; p\u2009=\u20090.019). \nConversely, traditional (infrapatellar and parapatellar) IMN approaches showed \nsignificantly increased anterior knee pain incidence compared to MIPO \n(RR\u2009=\u20096.27; 95% CI, 0.92-20.55; p\u2009=\u20090.002). Suprapatellar IMN studies did not \nreport anterior knee pain outcomes. No significant differences were identified \nbetween IMN and MIPO in nonunion rates (RR\u2009=\u20091.04; 95% CI, 0.61-1.77; p\u2009=\u20090.88), \nmalalignment incidence (RR\u2009=\u20091.29; 95% CI, 0.88-1.89; p\u2009=\u20090.19), knee range of \nmotion (WMD\u2009=\u20090.08; 95% CI, -2.22-2.37; p\u2009=\u20090.95), or implant removal rates \n(RR\u2009=\u20090.69; 95% CI, 0.41-1.15; p\u2009=\u20090.16).\nCONCLUSION: IMN fixation for proximal tibial fractures significantly reduces \ninfection risk compared with MIPO surgery, but traditional IMN approaches \n(infrapatellar/parapatellar) carry a greater risk of anterior knee pain. No \ndifferences were observed in nonunion rates, malalignment, knee range of motion, \nor implant removal rates between the two treatments. Further high-quality \nstudies evaluating suprapatellar IMN approaches are warranted.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

However, cement leakage \n(CL) after PVP remains a challenging problem. There is a lack of effective \nmethods to reduce CL. The objective of this study is to evaluate the \neffectiveness and safety of Valsalva maneuver-assisted percutaneous \nvertebroplasty (V-PVP) compared to conventional PVP in treating OVCFs.\nMETHODS: 302 patients were enrolled in this study. Patients were divided into \nthe V-PVP group and the conventional PVP group according to whether they \nreceived the Valsalva maneuver intraoperatively. Postoperative CT was performed \nto determine CL which can be classified as no leakage, cortical leakage, venous \nleakage, and cortical & venous leakage. CL rate and visual analog scale (VAS), \nperformed before surgery, 1\u00a0day, and 6 months after surgery, Operation time, \ncement volume, pulmonary embolism rate, and hospital stay were compared between \nthe two groups. The age, gender, BMI, BMD, fracture segment (thoracic, \nthoracolumbar, lumbar), fracture type (mild, moderate), cortical disrupture and \ncement volume of the two groups were also recorded, Multinomial Logistic \nregression analysis of all factors was conducted to analyze the relationship \nbetween all factors and CL.\nRESULTS: A total of 302 patients were enrolled (150\u00a0V-PVP and 152 PVP). The \nV-PVP group had significantly lower overall CL rates (36.7% vs. 77.6%), lower \npulmonary embolism rates (1.3% vs. 17.1%), and shorter hospital stays. Pain \nrelief was significantly better in the V-PVP group at 1\u00a0day and 6 months \npost-surgery (P\u2009<\u20090.01). Logistic regression analysis identified male gender and \nabsence of cortical disruption as protective factors against cortical leakage, \nwhile Genant grade 2 was a risk factor. Male gender and V-PVP treatment were \nprotective against venous leakage, whereas thoracic fractures and higher BMD \nwere risk factors. No significant differences were found in operation time or \ncement volume between the groups.\nCONCLUSION: V-PVP is a more effective and safer option than conventional PVP for \ntreating OVCFs, particularly in reducing cement leakage and pulmonary embolism \nrates. Future prospective studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to \nvalidate these findings.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

The purpose of \nthis study is to develop a virtual fracture reduction technique using \nconditional GAN (Generative Adversarial Network), and evaluate its performance \nin simulating and guiding reduction of femoral neck fracture, which is hard to \nreduce. We compared its reduction quality with manual reduction performed by \northopedic surgeons. It is a pilot study for augmented reality assisted femoral \nneck fracture surgery.\nMETHODS: To establish the gold standard of reduction, we invited an orthopedic \nsurgeon to perform virtual reduction registration with reference to the healthy \nproximal femur. The invited orthopedic surgeon also performed manual reduction \nby Mimics software to represent the capability of human doctor. Then we trained \nconditional GAN models on our dataset, which consisted 208 images from 208 \ndifferent patients. For displaced femoral neck fractures, it is not easy to \nmeasure the accurate angles, like Pauwels angle, of the fracture line. However, \nthe fracture lines would be clearer after reduction. We compared the results of \nmanual reduction, conditional GAN models and registration by Pauwels angle, \nGarden index and satisfied reduction rate. We tried different number of \ndownsampling (\u03b1) to optimize the performance of conditional GAN models.\nRESULTS: There were 208 pre-surgical CT scans from 208 patients included in our \nstudy (age 69.755\u2009\u00b1\u200913.728, including 88 men). The Pauwles angles of conditional \nGAN model(\u03b1\u2009=\u20090) was 38.519\u00b0, which was significantly more stable than manual \nreduction (44.647\u00b0, p\u2009<\u20090.001). The Garden indices of conditional GAN \nmodel(\u03b1\u2009=\u20090) was 176.726\u00b0, which was also significantly more stable than manual \nreduction (163.590\u00b0, p\u2009=\u20090.002). The satisfied reduction rate of conditional GAN \nmodel(\u03b1\u2009=\u20090) was 88.372%, significantly higher than manual reduction (53.488%, \np\u2009<\u20090.001). The Pauwels angles, Garden indices and satisfied reduction rate of \nconditional GAN model(\u03b1\u2009=\u20090) showed no difference to registration.\nCONCLUSION: Conditional GAN model(\u03b1\u2009=\u20090) can achieve better performance in the \nvirtual reduction of femoral neck fracture than orthopedic surgeon.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Overall survival was 76.0% (95% CI 74.4-77.7), 37.7% (95% CI \n35.6-39.9), and 11.9% (95% CI 9.6-14.8) at 1, 5, and 10\u00a0years. Advanced age, \nmale sex, and cognitive/functional impairment increased mortality. Comprehensive \nassessments are essential for personalized treatment.\nPURPOSE: Fragility hip fractures are increasing due to population aging. The \nmain objective of this study was to determine long-term survival and the \nprobability of dying from hip fracture or from other causes in patients over \n65\u00a0years old who underwent surgery for a fragility hip fracture.\nMETHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted between June 2010 and \nDecember 2021. The main outcomes were overall survival, relative survival, and \nthe probability of dying either from hip fracture or from other causes at 1, 5, \nand 10\u00a0years after surgery determined with the WebSurvCa application.\nRESULTS: A total of 2646 patients were included with a median age of 86.3\u00a0years \n[81.7-90.3]; 75% were women. Overall survival was 76.0% (95% CI 74.4-77.7), \n37.7% (95% CI 35.6-39.9), and 11.9% (95% CI 9.6-14.8) at 1, 5, and 10\u00a0years. The \ncumulative probability of dying from a hip fracture was 17.2%, 35.4%, and 49.4% \nat 1, 5, and 10\u00a0years, respectively. Factors such as advanced age, male sex, and \nprior functional or cognitive deterioration were associated with worse long-term \nsurvival. In patients over 85\u00a0years old, without functional dependence or with \nnormal cognitive status, the probability of dying from other causes at 5 and \n10\u00a0years exceeded that of dying from the hip fracture.\nCONCLUSION: Our results highlight that long-term mortality in these patients is \nhigh, persisting even 10\u00a0years after the fracture. Comprehensive evaluation \nconsidering age, functional, and cognitive status is essential in order to \npredict outcomes and personalize treatment strategies.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Despite \nadvancements in this technique, complications still occur. This study aims to \nevaluate the accuracy of IS screw placement assisted by intraoperative 3D \nnavigation.\nMETHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on patients treated for sacral \nfractures or SI joint dislocations between 2016 and 2023 at a single \ninstitution. All procedures were performed using O-Arm 3D fluoroscopy and \nStealthStation S8 navigation platform (Medtronic). For each screw, all accuracy \nmeasurements-including length, angulation, and cortical perforation-were \nperformed on the final 3D scans.\nRESULTS: Of the 241 screws implanted, 83.2% showed no perforation. Screw \nangulation was generally less accurate, with 26.5% of screws showing a minor \ndeviation of 5\u00b0 from the ideal trajectory. Accuracy was significantly lower in \nthe axial plane compared to the coronal plane. On average, the implanted screws \nreached 78% of the maximum length the S1 corridor could accommodate.\nCONCLUSION: This study represents the largest series to date of SI screw \nimplantation using 3D navigation. Navigation proved to be safe for IS screw \nplacement. Although overall accuracy in our series was slightly lower than that \nreported in other studies using the O-Arm, our sample included six times more \npatients, multiple surgeons, and a heterogeneous cohort. 3D navigation with \nO-Arm proved more helpful in avoiding cortical perforations than in improving \nscrew angulation.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) \nis a well-established method for preoperative analgesia in these patients, but \nwhether liposomal bupivacaine is more effective for this application remains \nuncertain. This trial aims to evaluate whether liposomal bupivacaine provides \nsuperior preoperative analgesia compared to ropivacaine in elderly patients with \nintertrochanteric femur fracture.\nMETHODS: This randomised controlled trial will include 84 elderly patients with \nintertrochanteric femur fracture. Participants will be randomised to receive \neither liposomal bupivacaine (n=42) or ropivacaine (n=42) via FICB. The outcomes \nassessed will include pain intensity, anxiety, sleep quality, additional \nanalgesic requirements and rebound pain from FICB administration until \npreprocedure. Additionally, the study will evaluate in-hospital complications, \nas well as clinical outcomes at 30 days postsurgery.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Approved by the Ethics Committee of Sichuan Province \nOrthopaedic Hospital (Approval No. KY2023-045-01), the study will be published \nin a peer-reviewed journal. Results will offer evidence-based insights into \noptimal preoperative analgesia for this patient population.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiCTR2400082747.\n\n\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

We found that 83.1% of patients did not receive \npost-fracture osteoporosis treatment, with a 1-year mortality rate of 37%. Prior \ntreatment, younger age, and parenteral medications were significant predictors \nof treatment adherence. These findings highlight the urgent need to address \ntreatment gaps and improve patient outcomes.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the osteoporosis treatment gap, \nmortality rates, and predictors of mortality in hip fracture patients in a \ntertiary center in Turkey.\nMETHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of 552 patients aged over \n50\u00a0years who were hospitalized for hip fractures at Prof. Dr. Cemil Ta\u015fc\u0131oglu \nCity Hospital between January 2015 and November 2022. Data were collected from \nelectronic medical records, including pre- and post-fracture osteoporosis \ntreatment, treatment initiation times, bone mineral density (BMD) tests, and \npatient outcomes.\nRESULTS: The mean age of the cohort was 80.2\u00a0years, with a predominance of \nfemale patients (65.1%). Prior to the fracture, 90.8% of patients had not \nreceived osteoporosis treatment. After the fracture, 83.1% of patients did not \nreceive any osteoporosis medications. Of those treated, 45 patients (8.6%) \nstarted treatment within 3\u00a0months. The 1-year mortality rate was 37%, with \nsignificant predictors including age, male gender, lack of prior osteoporosis \ntreatment, delayed treatment initiation, and short treatment duration. Only 5.6% \nof patients had a BMD test within the first year after the fracture, which was \nassociated with improved treatment adherence and lower mortality.\nCONCLUSIONS: The study highlights a significant treatment gap for osteoporosis \nin hip fracture patients in Turkey. Prior treatment history, younger age, and \nuse of parenteral therapies were strong predictors of adherence to post-fracture \nosteoporosis treatment. These findings emphasize the need for improved \nhealthcare provider awareness, better treatment initiation protocols, and the \nimplementation of Fracture Liaison Services.\n\n\u00a9 2025.
