This review article examines the influence of \nepigenetic alterations, namely DNA methylation and histone modifications, on the \nonset and advancement of conditions such as acute myeloid leukemia and \nmyelodysplastic syndromes. We discuss how these epigenetic modifications lead to \nthe deregulation of gene expression, eventually promoting leukemogenesis. The \nemergence of epigenetic therapies, such as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors \n(e.g., azacitidine and decitabine), histone deacetylase inhibitors (e.g., \nvorinostat and romidepsin), and enhancer of zeste homologue 2 inhibitors (e.g., \ntazmetostat), demonstrates the potential to reverse aberrant epigenetic \nmodifications and restoring normal cellular functions. Moreover, we highlight \ninnovative therapeutic approaches, including combination therapies and \nCRISPR-based epigenetic editing tools, which are influencing the future of \ntreatment for hematological malignancies. Despite promising results, challenges \nsuch as off-target effects, drug resistance, and the need for personalized \napproaches remain significant barriers to effective treatment. We emphasize that \nfurther study is required to improve delivery systems, comprehend resistance \nmechanisms and develop precision medicine strategies that can tailor therapies \nto individual patient profiles. By integrating benchside discoveries with \nclinical applications, this review aims to illuminate the transformative \npotential of epigenetic therapies in improving patient outcomes in hematology.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

During the \ncourse of their disease, a variety of health-related decisions need to be made \nfor and by SCD-patients, depending on their age and health status, together with \ntheir parents and paediatric haematology clinicians. Shared decision-making \n(SDM) may improve health outcomes of chronically ill children but is still not \ncommonly applied. We assessed the level of SDM among paediatric haematologists \nafter the introduction of SDM interventions. An observational post-intervention \nstudy was conducted in a paediatric outpatient clinic of a university hospital. \nAfter an SDM consultation training of the three paediatric haematologists and \nintroduction of SDM-supporting tools for both paediatricians and (parents of) \npatients with SCD, two evaluators independently and objectively analysed the \nlevel of patient involvement in decision-making from audio-recordings of the \nconsultations using the OPTION-5 instrument. SDM-Q-9 and SDM-Q-Doc \nquestionnaires were used to measure the level of SDM as perceived by \npatients/parents and paediatricians, respectively. Scores were expressed as a \npercentage, ranging from 0% (no SDM observed) to 100% (exemplary level of SDM). \nParticipants were 9 female and 9 male patients between 4\u00a0months and 17\u00a0years \nold, with a median age of 7.5\u00a0years (Interquartile Range [IQR] 2.5-12). Eighteen \nconsultations (six per paediatrician) in which a decision was to be made about \nSCD treatment options were analysed. Median OPTION-5 score was 50 (IQR 40-65%). \nMedian SDM-Q-9 and SDM-Q-Doc scores were 73% (IQR 52.2-91) and 62.2% (IQR \n55.6-71.1), respectively.\nCONCLUSION: After the introduction of SDM training and tools, paediatric \nhaematologists reached a moderately good level of SDM. This level had doubled as \ncompared to the baseline level, as assessed in a previous study.\nWHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022 Children who suffer from sickle cell disease (SCD) are \nvulnerable to health inequities and suboptimal health outcomes. Hence, SDM seems \nan appropriate method of care for these children. \u2022 SDM tools and training may \nhelp paediatricians and children participate in a collaborative decision-making \nprocess about the children's preferred treatment options and improve their \nhealth outcomes.\nWHAT IS NEW: \u2022 After SDM training and decision support aids for paediatricians \nand patients, the level of involvement in the decision-making process by (the \nparents of) patients suffering from SCD reached a moderately good level. \u2022 A \ndifference persists between paediatricians' perceived level of involving the \nchild and parents in a shared decision-making process and the observed level of \ninvolvement.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

The institutional acute \ncare clinic identified a critical gap in standardized triage processes, which \nleads to variability in patient assessment and care. Recognizing the necessity \nfor a streamlined approach, a structured, evidence-based triage pathway was \ndeveloped to improve consistency and quality of care.MethodA systematic review \nof institutional triage operations was initiated, pinpointing significant \ndiscrepancies and reliance on outdated practices. A multidisciplinary team \nformulated a set of electronic medical record (EMR)-integrated triage templates \nderived from established triage resources. These templates structured the \ndocumentation process and facilitated real-time patient information access, and \ncomprehensive nurse training on these new protocols was conducted through \nsimulations to ensure adept use of the system.ResultsThe new triage system \nstandardized patient assessment by using a color-coded algorithm to prioritize \ncare based on severity, replacing inconsistent practices with a unified \napproach. The integrated EMR templates enhanced documentation accuracy and \nstreamlined the assessment process, although the exact impact on workflow \nefficiency cannot be quantified without supporting data.DiscussionImplementation \nof this standardized triage pathway is a significant advancement in acute care \nfor PHO patients, promoting consistent and reliable patient assessments. This \napproach underscores the importance of uniform care delivery and sets a \nfoundation for continuous improvement and potential adoption by other \ninstitutions.\n\nDOI: 10.1177/27527530251319285\nPMID: 40443344 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe authors \ndeclared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, \nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\n\n5.

Eligible studies included SRs, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), \nand matched cohort observational studies between 1946 and March 2025. \nPopulations included were hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia, periprocedural \nprophylaxis, cardiovascular surgery, consumptive thrombocytopenia, and \nintracranial hemorrhage. The intervention was restrictive versus liberal \nplatelet transfusion strategies on outcomes of mortality and bleeding. Duplicate \nscreening and data extraction occurred. Meta-analysis used Mantel-Haenszel \nmethod of random effects model.\nRESULTS: Twenty-one RCTs, 24 observational studies, and 20 SRs were included. \nThe evidence quality varied. For hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia, 11 RCTs \nwere analyzed, with 9 RCTs at moderate risk of bias (ROB). Two RCTs were \nidentified for dengue, with high ROB for bleeding. One RCT was identified each \nin cardiovascular surgery, intracranial hemorrhage, and periprocedural \nprophylaxis. Meta-analyses indicated no significant effect for outcomes of \nmortality or bleeding by strategy, but confidence intervals (CIs) were wide. \nEffect estimates were 1.32 [0.93, 1.86] for all-cause mortality in \nhypoproliferative thrombocytopenia, 0.80 [0.38, 1.70] in cardiovascular surgery, \nand 0.69 [0.47, 1.03] in critically ill neonates or dengue patients.\nDISCUSSION: A consistent lack of benefit with liberal platelet transfusion was \nobserved across analyzed populations, although wide confidence intervals do not \nexclude clinically meaningful impacts. Important research gaps are highlighted \nin areas where the RCT data is limited.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

In the last 6 \nyears, there has been a 10-fold increase in the number of children involved in \nVTE treatment trials.\nOBJECTIVE: The ASH Committee on Quality and Guidelines agreed to update the \npediatric guidelines in conjunction with the International Society on Thrombosis \nand Haemostasis (ISTH). These ASH/ISTH evidence-based guidelines are intended to \nsupport patients, clinicians, and other health care professionals in the \nmanagement of pediatric patients with VTE.\nMETHODS: ASH/ISTH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel to minimize \npotential bias from conflicts of interest. An unconflicted patient \nrepresentative was not identified. The University of Kansas Health System \nsupported the guideline development process, updating or performing systematic \nevidence reviews up to 2024. The panel focused specifically on the 2018 \nquestions for which there was the greatest amount of interim data. The panel \nused the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and \nEvaluation) approach, including GRADE Evidence-to-Decision frameworks, to assess \nevidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment.\nRESULTS: The panel agreed on 20 recommendations and also provided implementation \nguidance on the optimal use of anticoagulants in pediatric patients. Key \nrecommendations of these guidelines include the role of DOACs in the treatment \nof a variety of pediatric VTEs.\nCONCLUSIONS: Further research is required. Key priorities are understanding the \nnatural history of clinically unsuspected thrombosis across a range of patient \nsubpopulations and obtaining real-world data on the use of DOACs in children.\n\n\u00a9 2025 American Society of Hematology.

The data was collected via \nquestionnaires using Likert-scaled items.\nRESULTS: In one outpatient cancer center a total of 279 students attended the \nonline lessons (2020-2023). 102 evaluations were collected, and all aspects of \nteaching of the online seminars and clerkship were rated very well (mean score \nof 1.2 on the item \"overall evaluation\" with a small range of 1.0-1.3, n\u2009=\u2009102). \nCriticism was mainly leveled at technical issues (n\u2009=\u200916). The evaluations \n(n\u2009=\u200910) of the students attending a one-day bed side teaching revealed high \ninterest in learning the practice in the outpatient setting. 90% stated an \nimprovement in understanding of outpatient practice as well as intersectoral \nprocesses due to the one-day bedside teaching and favored an integration of this \nnew teaching format into the regular medical curriculum. Two students applied \nfor a four-week internship and six chose a mentorship in hematology-oncology, \nresulting in four medical thesis projects in this field.\nCONCLUSION: Increased participation of outpatient centers in medical education \nimproved knowledge on outpatient medicine and interprofessional care and \ngenerated interest in the field of oncology.

The CLSI EP28 \nnon-parametric method, based on the Harris-Boyd framework, is widely used but \nhas limitations in handling outliers and skewed distributions. Emerging \ncomputational approaches, including Expectation-Maximization (EM), reflimR, and \nrefineR, offer improved RI estimation. This study evaluates the limitations of \nCLSI EP28 in transfusion medicine and compares EM, reflimR, and refineR to \nassess their effectiveness in refining RI estimation.A simulated blood donor \ndataset (n\u202f=\u202f500) was generated, modelling hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), \nand platelet count (PLT). Four RI estimation methods were compared: (1) CLSI \nEP28 (Non-Parametric Percentile Method), (2) Expectation-Maximization (EM) \nAlgorithm, (3) reflimR (Robust Regression Method) and, (4) refineR (Advanced \nStatistical Modeling Method).The dataset had mean values of 15\u202fg/dL (Hb), 44\u202f% \n(Hct), and 250\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2079/L (PLT). CLSI EP28 and EM yielded similar RIs, relying on \nempirical percentiles. ReflimR and refineR produced wider RIs, improving outlier \nresistance and distributional accuracy.While CLSI EP28 remains the regulatory \nstandard, computational RI estimation methods improve accuracy, robustness, and \nregulatory compliance (IVDR, FDA 510(k), ISO 15189). Implementing EM, reflimR, \nand refineR can enhance donor screening and transfusion safety.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, cancer genomic \nprofiling tests are underutilized in clinical practice. This highlights an \nurgent need to explore the genomic landscape of NPC and its potential \ntherapeutic implications.&lt;b&gt;Aim:&lt;/b&gt; The aim of this study is to \ninvestigate the genetic mutational landscape of recurrent and/or metastatic \nnasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).&lt;b&gt;Materials and methods:&lt;/b&gt; Data \nwere analyzed for 67 consecutive patients with NPC registered at the Japan \nNational Cancer Center, Center for Cancer Genomics and Advanced Therapeutics \n(C-CAT) between June 2019 and May 2024. Genetic mutations were determined by \nFoundationOne CDx or Liquid CDx next-generation sequencing. Survival of patients \nwas determined by the log-rank test and a Cox proportional hazards \nmodel.&lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; The top 10 mutations in NPC were \n&lt;i&gt;CDKN2A&lt;/i&gt; (41.8%), &lt;i&gt;CDKN2B&lt;/i&gt; (31.3%), \n&lt;i&gt;TP53&lt;/i&gt; (20.9%), &lt;i&gt;KMT2D&lt;/i&gt; (20.9%), \n&lt;i&gt;DNMT3A&lt;/i&gt; (19.4%), &lt;i&gt;NOTCH1&lt;/i&gt; (17.9%), \n&lt;i&gt;STK11&lt;/i&gt; (17.9%), &lt;i&gt;MTAP&lt;/i&gt; (17.9%), \n&lt;i&gt;EP300&lt;/i&gt; (17.9%), &lt;i&gt;TSC1&lt;/i&gt; (13.4%), with 11.1 6.1 \n(mean SEM) mutations/individual.

Tirzepatide treatment significantly \ninhibited glioma cell proliferation and migration, as demonstrated by the CCK-8 \nand Transwell migration assays. Tirzepatide also induced lipid peroxidation, \nevidenced by increased ROS levels, elevated MDA production, and reduced SOD \nactivity, while the GSH/GSSG ratio was decreased, reflecting oxidative stress. \nFerroptosis was further confirmed by increased Fe2+ concentrations and \nalterations in iron metabolism-related genes (Ferritin and TFR1) and lipid \nmetabolism-related genes (ACSL4 and GPX4). Tirzepatide also inhibited the \nSOX2/SLC7A11 axis, which plays a critical role in resisting ferroptosis. Fer-1, \na ferroptosis inhibitor, or SOX2 overexpression, markedly reduced Tirzepatide's \neffects on proliferation, migration, lipid peroxidation, and ferroptosis, \nhighlighting the critical role of the SOX2/SLC7A11 axis in mediating these \neffects. These findings indicate that Tirzepatide inhibits glioma cell growth by \ninducing ferroptosis, presenting a potential therapeutic approach for glioma.\n\n\u00a9 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.\n\nDOI: 10.1002/jbt.70392\nPMID: 40678831 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n13.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have shown \npromise in enhancing survival, but they are associated with immune-related \nadverse events, including potentially life-threatening myocarditis. Moreover, \nICI-induced myocarditis can be asymptomatic, necessitating early diagnosis. \nSpecific risk factors and biomarkers for esophageal cancer remain poorly \ncharacterized.\nAIM: To investigate the determinants of ICI-associated asymptomatic myocarditis \nin patients with esophageal cancer and explore potential early biomarkers.\nMETHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 202 cancer patients who \nreceived treatment at Shanxi Province Cancer Hospital from July 2019 to July \n2024.\nRESULTS: Older age, male gender, and elevated creatine kinase isoenzymes (CK-MB) \nand CK levels were found to be significant risk factors for asymptomatic \nmyocarditis. The myocarditis occurrence group had higher CK-MB (3.05 ng/mL vs \n5.02 ng/mL; P < 0.001) and CK levels (187.29 U/L vs 212.25 U/L; P = 0.005), and \nthe predictive value of age, gender, CK, and CK-MB was low [are under the \nreceiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.579-0.608]. However, their \ncombination in a predictive model showed improved diagnostic capability, with an \nAUC of 0.808.\nCONCLUSION: Age, gender, and cardiac biomarker levels considerably contribute to \nthe risk of ICI-related myocarditis in patients with esophageal cancer. The \nintegration of these factors into a predictive model enhances early diagnosis, \nfacilitating personalized risk management.\n\n\u00a9The Author(s) 2025.

Autophagy plays a pivotal role in the immune response and \nfunctions as a lysosome-mediated degradation mechanism essential for recycling \ncellular components and eliminating aggregated proteins, damaged organelles, and \ninvasive pathogens, thereby maintaining cellular function and dynamic \nhomeostasis. Additionally, autophagy regulates several critical proteins and \nsignaling pathways, including mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR), \nBeclin-1, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mTOR signaling \npathway, the Hippo/yes-associated protein signaling pathway, and the Janus \nkinase/signal transducer of activation signaling pathway. This regulatory \ncapacity of autophagy can potentially prevent or delay the progression of HCC. \nNowadays, many studies have shown that different types of herbal monomers such \nas the more common quercetin, baicalein, berberine and emodin can further \nregulate autophagy and exert preventive and therapeutic effects on HCC through \nthe modulation of mTOR and other related signaling pathways and so on. In this \npaper, we examine the mechanisms of autophagy, key proteins and signaling \npathways involved, and the modulation of autophagy by Chinese medicine monomers \nin the prevention and treatment of HCC. This review aims to provide valuable \ninsights for the development of Chinese medicine strategies against HCC and to \ninform the rational use of these therapies in clinical practice.\n\n\u00a9The Author(s) 2025.

High-throughput sequencing was conducted to identify differentially \nexpressed serum exosomal miRNAs, which were subsequently validated using TaqMan \nprobe-based reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. \nBioinformatic analyses were performed to predict downstream target genes and \nexplore their roles in metastatic progression.\nRESULTS: Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the isolated exosomes \nwere predominantly round or oval with well-defined membrane boundaries. \nNanoparticle tracking analysis showed a peak particle size of approximately 138 \nnm, accounting for 99.2% of total particles, consistent with the typical size \nrange of exosomes. Western blotting confirmed the expression of exosome-specific \nmarkers CD63 and CD81. High-throughput sequencing identified 42 differentially \nexpressed exosomal miRNAs between metastatic and non-metastatic groups. Among \nthem, hsa-let-7f-5p was significantly upregulated in metastatic pancreatic \ncancer (P = 0.007), as validated by reverse transcription-quantitative \npolymerase chain reaction. Target gene prediction indicated that hsa-let-7f-5p \nmay be involved in metastasis through its interactions with nerve growth factor, \ncyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A, high mobility group AT-hook 2, \ninsulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1, and insulin-like growth \nfactor 2 mRNA-binding protein 3.\nCONCLUSION: The elevated expression of serum exosomal hsa-let-7f-5p in \nmetastatic pancreatic cancer suggests its potential as a non-invasive biomarker \nfor distinguishing metastatic from non-metastatic disease.\n\n\u00a9The Author(s) 2025.

The present study was thus developed to explore the \nmechanistic importance of HDAC10 as a regulator of CRC.\nAIM: To investigate the impact of HDAC10 on tumor growth and its regulation in \ntumor microenvironment (TME) in CRC, we conducted this study.\nMETHODS: The study evaluated HDAC10 expression using immunohistochemistry \nanalyses and assessed its prognostic value in CRC patients. HDAC10 depletion CRC \ncell lines were generated, and its biological functions were assessed through \ncell counting kit-8, wound healing, and colony formation assays. Furthermore, \ngene set variation analysis (GSVA) was employed to explore the potential \nmolecular mechanisms of HDAC10 in CRC. The impact of HDAC10 on TME was \nsubsequently assessed. Finally, the study investigated the influence of HDAC10 \non the response to immunotherapy and chemotherapeutic drugs in CRC.\nRESULTS: HDAC10 expression was significantly elevated in CRC and correlated with \npoor prognosis in patients. Knockdown of HDAC10 reduced colon cancer cell \nproliferation and migration capabilities. GSVA revealed a strong association \nbetween high HDAC10 expression and immune suppression. Additionally, high HDAC10 \nlevels were correlated with a non-inflamed TME. Finally, patients with high \nHDAC10 expression showed reduced sensitivity to immunotherapy.\nCONCLUSION: This study revealed the significance of HDAC10 in TME, therapy \nefficacy, and clinical prognosis in CRC, offering novel insights for therapeutic \nadvancements in CRC.\n\n\u00a9The Author(s) 2025.

The joinpoint regression analysis model was employed to assess temporal \ntrends, and the average annual percent change (AAPC) was calculated to summarize \nthe trends over the study period.\nRESULTS: Globally, the number of incident childhood cases of MNBAC increased \nfrom 9,827 in 1990 to 12,294 in 2021, with an AAPC of 0.38. Similarly, the \nprevalence of the disease also increased, with an AAPC of 0.39. However, the \nmortality rate and DALYs rate showed a slight decline, with an AAPC of -0.16 and \n-0.16 respectively. At the national level, the United States had the highest \nincidence and prevalence rates, while India had the highest number of incident \ncases and DALYs. China showed the largest increase in prevalence, with an AAPC \nof 1.88. India also demonstrated the most significant decline in mortality and \nDALYs rates. Additionally, the mortality rate and DALYs rate were slightly \nhigher for male children compared to female patients.\nCONCLUSION: Malignant bone and articular cartilage tumors in children remain a \nsignificant public health challenge globally. By strengthening monitoring, \nincreasing investment in medical resources, promoting early screening and \nintervention, and enhancing international cooperation and exchange, we hope to \nfurther reduce the burden of childhood bone cancer and improve children's \nquality of life and health standards.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Li and Yuan.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fpubh.2025.1481304\nPMCID: PMC12267175\nPMID: 40678654 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n18.

However, the association between GDM and the risk of breast cancer \nremains controversial.\nOBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to comprehensively \nevaluate the association between GDM and the risk of breast cancer and explore \nits underlying mechanisms.\nMETHODS: This study systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, \nEMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases, covering the period from \nestablishing each database until April 14, 2025. Two researchers extracted \nrelevant data and assessed the quality of included studies using the \nNewcastle-Ottawa Scale. The study evaluated inter-study heterogeneity using the \nI\u00b2 statistic. Based on the magnitude of heterogeneity, fixed-effect or \nrandom-effect models were employed to calculate the pooled hazard ratio (HR) and \nits corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Additionally, subgroup analyses, \nsensitivity analyses, funnel plot analyses, and publication bias assessments \nwere performed. All data analyses were conducted using STATA 17 software.\nRESULTS: The overall analysis revealed no significant association between GDM \nand breast cancer risk (HR=1.03, 95%CI: 0.92-1.15). However, subgroup analysis \nrevealed significant regional heterogeneity: within the regional subgroups, \nNorth American results showed an association between GDM and a reduced breast \ncancer risk (HR=0.89, 95%CI: 0.84-0.95), whereas Asian findings suggested an \nassociation with an increased risk (HR=1.23, 95%CI: 1.15-1.31). No significant \nassociations were observed in subgroups based on study design \n(cohort/case-control) or follow-up duration (short-term/long-term). Sensitivity \nanalysis demonstrated robust results, and there was no publication bias in this \nstudy.\nCONCLUSION: In summary, there is no significant association between GDM and \nbreast cancer risk overall. However, notable regional heterogeneity exists: in \nthe North American subgroup, GDM is associated with a reduced risk of breast \ncancer, while in the Asian subgroup, GDM is significantly associated with an \nincreased risk of breast cancer.\nSYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/, identifier \nCRD420251032589.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Li, Li, Jin, Zhang, Li, Xu, Wang, Hu, Wang and Yu.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fendo.2025.1621932\nPMCID: PMC12267041\nPMID: 40678319 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n19.

Typically, diagnosis relies on visual assessment of area, texture, \nand color. A few studies have focused on various color attributes in superficial \nand mixed Infantile hemangioma types, neglecting the deep category. Limited \nresearch has explored temperature in the location of hemangioma lesions.\nAIM: We seek, for the first time, to quickly identify and classify infantile \nhemangioma lesions using a portable, programmable handheld device. The system \naims to (1) replicate a physician's assessment of infantile hemangioma and (2) \ndeliver an easy way to understand automatic diagnosis.\nAPPROACH: The custom-built device comprises an infrared sensor and a visible \nlight spectrum sensor to assess color and depth through computations of \ndifferent color and texture features. Over a 3-year period, 53 patients were \nmonitored, and 83 hemangioma images were captured.\nRESULTS: The device accurately localized all lesions in real time and classified \nhemangioma lesions into three primary types using selected color and texture \nfeatures. Evaluation metrics showed an average sensitivity of 0.8948 and \nspecificity of 0.7313 for an accuracy of 0.7572 and an average sensitivity of \n0.7803 and specificity of 0.8720 for an F -score of 0.7826 in the three-class \nclassification.\nCONCLUSIONS: The two-sensor device accurately identifies and categorizes \ninfantile hemangioma lesions, providing a clear automated diagnosis based on \ncomputerized features.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Authors.\n\nDOI: 10.1117/1.JBO.30.7.075001\nPMCID: PMC12270544\nPMID: 40678080 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n20.

Employing a national \ndatabase, we examined the pre- and postoperative incidences of epilepsy/seizures \nand risk factors associated with postoperative epilepsy/seizures in patients \nreadmitted within 30 days and/or 90 days following meningioma resection. \nMethods: The 2010-2014 Nationwide Readmissions Database was analyzed. \nConsecutive patients undergoing surgery for meningioma resection were identified \nusing appropriate ICD-9-CM codes. Standard descriptive techniques and \nmultivariate regression were used to identify predictors of postoperative \nepilepsy/seizure after discharge. Results: Among 46,107 patients undergoing \nmeningioma resection at index hospitalization, 20.40% (n = 9408) had \npreoperative epilepsy/seizure diagnosis. The mean patient age was 58.37 \u00b1 \n13.85\u2009years. Patients with preoperative epilepsy/seizures were more likely to be \nmale (p < 0.001), frail (p < 0.001), and with higher comorbidity index scores (p \n< 0.001). The overall readmission rate was 30.36% and was higher among patients \nwith preoperative epilepsy/seizures (36.66% vs. 28.75%, p < 0.001). \nRespectively, 30- and 90-day readmission rates were higher among patients \n(13.22% vs. 11.73%, p < 0.001) and (23.25% vs 20.30%, p = 0.04) with \nepilepsy/seizure diagnosis at index admission. Predictors of postoperative \nepilepsy/seizures at 30- and 90-day readmissions included the preoperative \nepilepsy/seizure, malignant meningioma, peritumoral cerebral edema, and higher \ncomorbidity index scores, while male sex was significant only at 30-day \nreadmissions. Intraoperative electrocorticography was associated with a \ndecreased likelihood of postoperative epilepsy/seizures. Conclusion: Development \nof epilepsy/seizures after meningioma resection is likely multifactorial. \nIdentifying factors associated with postoperative epilepsy/seizures after \ndischarge is important in triaging and closer monitoring of at-risk patients and \nfor adapting management to help improve outcomes.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Rasha Elbadry et al.

To \nevaluate the association between healthcare provider discussion of preparedness \nand level of preparedness.\nBACKGROUND: Research demonstrates that extreme weather events and public health \nemergencies result in increased hospital visits for people with sickle cell \ndisease, yet little is known about home disaster preparedness knowledge and \nactions of these individuals.\nMETHODS: Cross-sectional study of US adults diagnosed with sickle cell disease. \nThe independent variable was the healthcare provider discussion of household \ndisaster preparedness. The dependent variable was the Household Emergency \nPreparedness Instrument's General Preparedness score. Participants self-reported \ntheir preparedness actions and disaster supplies through an online survey. \nDescriptive statistics were analyzed, along with a Welch t test, to examine the \nassociations between the study variables. This study was reported according to \nthe STROBE checklist.\nRESULTS: The average General Preparedness score of this sample (N = 32) \nindicated that the majority of participants were not considered well prepared \nfor disasters. Higher scores were found among participants who had discussions \nwith their healthcare providers about how to prepare for disasters.\nDISCUSSION: The sample's average General Preparedness score was higher than \nother patient populations assessed with this instrument, possibly due to routine \ndiscussions about medical emergency preparedness that individuals with sickle \ncell disease receive from healthcare providers.\nCONCLUSION: Home disaster preparedness levels should be improved to decrease \ndisaster-related morbidity and mortality.\nIMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE AND POLICY: Nurses should develop or advocate \nfor home disaster preparedness lessons, community interventions, and public \npolicies to meet the unique needs of community members with sickle cell disease \nbefore, during, and after disasters.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

This scoping review aims to \nprovide a comprehensive description of the clinical features of ICI-associated \nIHA.\nMETHODS: PubMed and Web of Science Core Collection databases were searched for \narticles published in English from January 2006 to January 2025 on \nICI-associated IHA. Only full-text publications reporting the clinical \ncharacteristics of patients with ICI-associated IHA were included. Two authors \nindependently assessed the search results for eligibility and extracted the \nfollowing information: author, publication year, patient characteristics, and \nIHA features.\nRESULTS: Among 54 publications, published between July 2014 and March 2024, 92 \ncases of ICI-associated IHA were identified, revealing a high proportion of \ncases in patients with melanoma (45.2%) and non-small-cell lung cancer (31%). \nApproximately half of the cases occurred in patients receiving ICIs as \nfirst-line systemic therapy, with IHA manifesting after a median of 3 cycles. \nThe most frequent triggering ICIs were pembrolizumab (41.3%) and nivolumab \n(26.1%). A high proportion of cases involved patients with a medical history of \nhematolymphoid tumors (34.8%), hypertension (15.2%), and anemia/AIHA (15.2%). \nInitial management involved ICI discontinuation (94.6%), high-dose \nglucocorticoids therapy (97.8%), and transfusion support (63%), with treatment \nresponses achieved in most cases (91.3%). Only 2 cases reported fatal outcomes. \nIHA relapse was documented in only 7 of 23 (30.4%) patients who were \nrechallenged with an ICI.\nCONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest scoping review of \npopulation-based studies, case reports, and case series on ICI-associated IHA. \nThe evidence reviewed suggests that patients with specific comorbidities may be \nat higher risk of developing ICI-associated IHA. In the absence of predictive \ntools to individually estimate the risk of this complication, a list of \nfrequently reported co-occurring conditions in cases of ICI-associated IHA may \nhelp select patients who could benefit from closer surveillance.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Hernandez-Martinez, Rios-Garcia, Palomares-Palomares and \nArrieta.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1586426\nPMCID: PMC12268707\nPMID: 40677712 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as potential conflicts of interest.\n\n\n23.

Among adolescent \ngirls, the prevalence of anemia is higher due to increased demands for blood \nvolume expansion associated with the onset of menstruation and the rapid growth \nduring adolescence. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis was \nconducted to estimate the pooled prevalence of anemia and its associated factors \namong adolescent girls in East and West African countries.\nMETHODS: All published and unpublished studies from East and West Africa \navailable in PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Hinari, and Google Scholar were \nscreened based on their titles, abstracts, study design, and full-text review \nbefore inclusion in the meta-analysis. Data were extracted after assessing the \nquality of evidence using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal \ntool for cross-sectional studies. Microsoft Excel was used for data extraction, \nand STATA version 14 was employed for statistical analysis. A forest plot was \nused to display the pooled prevalence of anemia among adolescent girls in East \nand West Africa. Heterogeneity was assessed using random-effects models, \nsubgroup analysis, meta-regression, and sensitivity analysis. Publication bias \nwas evaluated using Egger's regression test and funnel plot analysis. Odds \nratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to present the \nfactors associated with anemia among adolescent girls.\nRESULTS: A total of twenty-nine studies involving 12,905 participants were \nincluded in the analysis. The pooled prevalence of anemia among adolescent girls \nwas 32.88% [95% CI: 24.62%, 41.14%], based on a random-effects model. The \nmeta-analysis also identified significant associations between anemia and \ncertain factors. Adolescent girls living in rural areas were more likely to have \nanemia compared to those in urban areas (OR\u2009=\u20094.19; 95% CI: 1.42, 12.41; I\u00b2 = \n76.2%, p\u2009=\u20090.006). Additionally, girls who had not heard about anemia had \nsignificantly higher odds of being anemic (OR\u2009=\u200912.25; 95% CI: 4.59, 32.64; I\u00b2 = \n81.1%, p\u2009<\u20090.01).\nCONCLUSION: The pooled prevalence of anemia among adolescent girls in East and \nWest African countries represents a moderate public health concern. Adolescent \ngirls living in rural areas and those who had not heard about anemia were \nsignificantly more likely to develop the condition. Addressing this nutritional \nchallenge requires strong intersectoral collaboration between the health and \neducation sectors to promote awareness, prevention, and effective interventions \ntargeting adolescent girls.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Therefore, this \nstudy aimed to better understand the perspectives and experiences of clinicians \nregarding integrating palliative care for patients with hematological \nmalignancies.\nMETHODS: Interviews were conducted with clinicians who care for hematological \npatients. The interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis.\nRESULTS: Participants acknowledged the importance of integrating palliative \ncare. However, they noted that patients with hematological malignancies often \nhave a more unpredictable disease course than patients with solid tumors. \nUnpredictability and the potential for rapid deterioration were identified as \nmain barriers to the integration of palliative care. In addition, participants \nindicated that the availability of multiple treatment options may result in a \ntendency to prioritize these treatments over integrating palliative care. The \nparticipants recommended that palliative care should have a prominent position \nin the hematology curriculum and suggested that including palliative care topics \nin conferences could enhance awareness.\nCONCLUSIONS: To integrate palliative care into hematological malignancy care, it \nis necessary to enhance the knowledge and awareness of palliative care among \nhematological clinicians. A two-track approach, where both curative and \npalliative pathways coexist, could facilitate the integration of palliative \ncare.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Improvements have been made to \nidentify recurrent genetic mutations and their functional roles, but translating \nthis into preclinical models is still difficult. Traditional murine systems lack \nthe human-specific cytokine support and microenvironmental support that is \nnecessary to reproduce MDS pathophysiology. Humanized mouse models, particularly \nthose incorporating human cytokines (e.g., MISTRG, NSG-SGM3, NOG-EXL), \nimmunodeficient backgrounds, and co-transplantation strategies, have improved \nthe engraftment and differentiation of human hematopoietic stem and progenitor \ncells. These models allow the study of clonal evolution, mutation-specific \ndisease dynamics, and response to therapies in vivo. However, difficulties \npersist, such as limited long-term engraftment, incomplete immune \nreconstruction, and limited possibilities of modeling early-stage or low-risk \nMDS. This review presents an overview of current humanized and genetically \nengineered mouse models suitable for studying MDS, evaluating their capacity to \nreplicate disease complexity, preserve clonal architecture, and support \ntranslational research.

The most common form of treatment for \nCML is imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Although imatinib is an effective \ntreatment for CML and most patients treated with imatinib do attain some form of \nremission, imatinib does not completely eradicate all leukemia cells, and if \ntreatment is stopped, all patients eventually relapse. Kim et al. constructed a \nsystem of delay differential equations to mathematically model the dynamics of \nanti-leukemia T-cell responses to CML during imatinib treatment, and \ndemonstrated the usefulness of the mathematical model for studying novel \ntreatment regimes to enhance imatinib therapy. Paquin et al. demonstrated \nnumerically using this DDE model that strategic treatment interruptions (STIs) \nmay have the potential to completely eradicate CML in certain cases. We \nconducted a comprehensive numerical study of the model parameters to identify \nthe mathematical and numerical significance of the individual parameter values \non the efficacy of imatinib treatment of CML. In particular, we analyzed the \neffects of the numerical values of the model parameters on the behavior of the \nsystem, revealing critical threshold values that impact the ability of imatinib \ntreatment to achieve remission and/or elimination. We also showed that STIs \nprovide improvements to these critical values, categorizing this change as it \nrelates to parameters inherent to either CML growth or immune response.\n\nDOI: 10.3934/mbe.2025057\nPMID: 40676983 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n28.

Although no significant \ndifference in complete remission rates was observed between the groups after \ninitial treatment, the median overall survival for triple-mutated AML patients \nwas only 4 months. Using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and \nbioinformatics, we compared AMLNPM1mutFLT3-ITDmutDNMT3Amut and \nAMLNPM1mutFLT3-ITDmutDNMT3Awt. A total of 246 AML patients from the GEO dataset \nwere included to evaluate the expression profiles of differentially expressed \ngenes. The guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit \u03b3 4 (GNG4) was \ndifferentially expressed between AMLNPM1mutFLT3-ITDmutDNMT3Amut and \nAMLNPM1mutFLT3-ITDmutDNMT3Awt, which had the most adjacent nodes among hub \ngenes. The prognostic value of GNG4 was further validated in AML patient samples \nthrough qRT-PCR.ConclusionClinical validation indicated a substantial \ndownregulation of GNG4 in AMLNPM1mutFLT3-ITDmutDNMT3Amut compared to \nAMLNPM1mutFLT3-ITDmutDNMT3Awt patients. Thus, GNG4 may play a role in the low \nsurvival rate of AMLNPM1mutFLT3-ITDmutDNMT3Amut patients, offering novel \ninsights into the prognosis, therapeutic targets, and prognostic evaluation of \nAML.\n\nPlain Language Summary: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of blood cancer \nthat can be influenced by various genetic mutations. In this study, we focused \non a specific group of AML patients who have mutations in three genes: \nNucleophosmin 1 (NPM1), FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication \n(FLT3-ITD), and de novo methyl transferase 3 A (DNMT3A). These patients tend to \nhave a poor prognosis. We compared 165 AML patients, analyzing those with these \nthree mutations (referred to as the triple-mutated group) and those without. Our \nfindings showed that patients with the triple mutations had higher white blood \ncell counts, more blast cells in the bone marrow, and higher platelet counts \ncompared to patients without the triple mutations. All of the triple-mutated \npatients were also classified under a particular subtype of AML, the M4/M5 \nsubtype. However, even though the two groups had similar remission rates after \ninitial treatment, patients with the triple mutations had a much shorter overall \nsurvival rate, with a median survival of just 4 months. We also used a large \ndataset to examine gene expression patterns in these patients. One gene, called \nGNG4, was found to be significantly downregulated in patients with the triple \nmutations. This gene may help explain the poor survival outcomes for these \npatients. Our results suggest that GNG4 could serve as a potential target for \nfuture therapies and may help doctors predict the prognosis of AML patients with \nthis triple mutation.\n\nDOI: 10.1177/10732748251359836\nPMID: 40676766 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe \nauthor(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the \nresearch, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\n\n29.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) revolutionized the CML treatment and \nhelped patients to achieve a higher survival rate. However, TKI resistance, \nleukemia stem cell (LSC) persistence, and disease relapse highlight the \nnecessity for alternative treatment strategies. Furthermore, oxidative stress \npathways are critical in promoting leukemic development and resistance, offering \nan emerging avenue for targeted intervention. This review explores several \npromising therapeutic targets in CML, such as suppressor pathways, autophagy \nmodulation, the BCL-2 family proteins, and microRNAs (miRNAs) modulation. \nRestoring the function of tumor suppressors, such as PTPRG and p53, may \ncomplement current therapies since they are essential in regulating cell \nproliferation and apoptosis. Tumor suppressors offer the potential to enhance \napoptosis, while the precise modulation of autophagy, a complex cellular process \nwith context-dependent roles, can regulate cell survival under therapeutic \npressure. The BCL-2 family proteins regulate apoptosis by the mitochondrial \nintrinsic apoptosis pathway, representing a critical target for overcoming \napoptotic resistance in CML cells. Meanwhile, miRNAs emerge as potent modulators \nof oncogenic and apoptotic pathways by acting as tumor suppressors or oncomiRs, \npresenting an opportunity for advanced treatment. This review also includes gene \nediting to target oncogenic drivers or correcting mutations and USP inhibition \nto overcome resistance. Finally, it concludes by emphasizing the importance of \ncombining these diverse therapeutic approaches with ongoing next-generation TKIs \nand comprehensive and personalized approaches for CML treatment, offering a path \ntoward deeper remissions and ultimately achieving curative outcomes for CML \npatients.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Although MDM2 \ninhibitors restore p53-mediated apoptosis in p53-functional CLL, single-agent \nactivity is limited by resistance mechanisms. Signal transducer and activator of \ntranscription 3 (STAT3) signaling also promotes CLL survival and immune evasion, \nsuggesting that concurrent blockade of both pathways may enhance cell death.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Here, the synergistic potential of the oral MDM2 antagonist \nBI-907828 (brigimadlin) and the STAT3 inhibitor BBI608 (napabucasin) was \nevaluated in two CLL cell lines with distinct TP53 (Tumor Protein p53, the gene \nencoding p53 protein) status: p53-wild-type EHEB and p53-mutant/17p-deleted \nMEC-1. Monotherapy with BI-907828 induced marked p53 stabilization, upregulation \nof p21WAF1, PARP cleavage, and caspase-3/7 activation in EHEB cells, whereas \nMEC-1 cells remained unresponsive. BBI608 alone reduced cell viability in both \nlines in a dose-dependent manner, with its effect in MEC-1 cells suggesting a \np53-independent mechanism. When combined, BI-907828 and BBI608 synergistically \nenhanced apoptotic markers in EHEB cells (\u03b4 synergy score\u2009>\u200917) but elicited no \nsynergy in MEC-1, underlining the requirement for intact p53.\nCONCLUSION: These findings establish a mechanistic rationale for the concurrent \ntargeting of the MDM2 and STAT3 axes and provide preclinical evidence for a \npromising, non-genotoxic therapeutic strategy in p53-functional CLL. A \nlimitation of this study is the lack of in vivo validation and clinical data, \nwhich are necessary to further assess the safety, optimal dosing, and efficacy, \nparticularly in elderly or unfit patients with limited treatment options.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

However, the clinical role of FOXP1 in \nhematologic malignancies has not been studied comprehensively. This study \nsystematically analyzed the association of FOXP1 expression with clinical \noutcomes, including prognosis and immunotherapeutic response, as well as \nbiological functions across a range of hematological cancers. Our findings \ndemonstrated that FOXP1 expression was dysregulated in several hematological \nmalignancies and was associated with poor prognosis. FOXP1 was highly expressed \nin acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Methylation of the FOXP1 promoter was \nsignificantly reduced in patients with AML compared to the healthy control \nsubjects and those with myelodysplastic syndromes. FOXP1 promoter methylation \nshowed an inverse relationship with FOXP1 gene expression in AML. Moreover, \nFOXP1 expression was associated with the tumor infiltration of B cells, natural \nkiller cells, and T cells, as well as the cytolytic score across various \nhematologic malignancies. Our data showed that FOXP1 expression was a promising \nbiomarker for predicting responses to immunotherapy in AML patients. \nFunctionally, the knockdown of FOXP1 demonstrated antileukemic effects, \nincluding reduced AML cell proliferation and cell cycle arrest in the G1-S \nphase. In conclusion, this study systematically investigated the role of FOXP1 \nacross a spectrum of hematological malignancies and demonstrated that FOXP1 was \na promising prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in AML and \nother hematological malignancies.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Wen, Xu, Ni, Liu, Jin, Zhao, Luo, Fang, Mao, Lin and Qian.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1569641\nPMCID: PMC12263946\nPMID: 40672953 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n34.

Logistic regression was used to analyze independent risk factors and \ndevelop a scoring system based on odds ratios, with ROC curves assessing the \nAUC. Both sets were classified into low and high risk using the system's \ncut-off, and the incidence of moderate/severe bleeding in each group was \ncalculated. The scoring system's relationship with the ISTH DIC score and their \ncombined diagnostic efficacy for DIC and bleeding events in APL patients were \nevaluated using AUC, specificity, and sensitivity.ResultsIn the development \ncohort, 15.7% (14 cases) had moderate/severe bleeding, while the validation \ncohort had 14.6% (7 cases). Multivariate logistic regression identified LDH \nlevels \u2265538 IU/L, fibrinogen <0.95\u2005g/L, and D-Dimer \u22656865\u2005ng/mL as independent \nrisk factors for early moderate/severe bleeding in APL patients. The new warning \nscoring system had an AUC of 0.899 in the development group and 0.937 in the \nvalidation group. High-risk patients in both cohorts were significantly more \nlikely to experience moderate/severe bleeding than low-risk patients (p\u2009<\u2009.001). \nThe ISTH DIC score is significantly linked to both bleeding severity and the \nwarning scoring system.ConclusionsThe warning scoring system shows potential for \npredicting the risk of moderate/severe bleeding in APL patients; however, \nfurther prospective validation studies are necessary to substantiate its \nefficacy.\n\nDOI: 10.1177/10760296251360019\nPMID: 40671664 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe authors \ndeclared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, \nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\n\n35.

It has been extensively studied and is used \nas a model for targeted therapy. In this study, we examine combination \ntreatments of type II Abl1 inhibitors and asciminib (an allosteric regulator) \nthrough a computational model at patient relevant concentrations. Due to the \nseparate binding sites of type II inhibitors and asciminib, we propose their \ncombination treatment as potentially robust to resistance. We find that the \nsimultaneous cobinding of type II inhibitors and asciminib is high in synergetic \ncombinations. As an aid to designing and comparing combination treatments, we \nput forward an equation that expands on the previously published effective ratio \nof IC50 (ERIC). Unlike usual comparisons of IC50 values, ERIC takes patient \nplasma concentrations into account. This study shows that the product of two \nERIC values ( ERICcombo ) creates comparable approximations of the effectiveness \nof combination treatments with low levels of synergy or antagonism at different \nconcentrations. Its simple formulation is done without experiments and requires \nless computation and input data than the current standard of ZIP values. As \nsuch, the new scheme is a useful complement to experiments that deal with \nsynergy in drug use.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

IL-6 produced by leukaemia cells suppresses \nADAMTS13 activity and impairs hematopoietic differentiation. Vitamin D, which \nhas known for its immunomodulatory effects, may reduce IL-6 levels. This study \ninvestigated the impact of vitamin D supplementation on IL-6 and ADAMTS13 levels \nin patients newly diagnosed with AML.\nPATIENTS AND METHOD: A total of 38 newly diagnosed AML patients and 14 healthy \nindividuals were included. IL-6 and ADAMTS13 levels were measured in both groups \nat baseline. Among AML patients, 34 were found to have vitamin D deficiency. \nSeventeen of these patients received oral vitamin D supplementation for 28 days \nin addition to their standard chemotherapy. Serum levels of IL-6, ADAMTS13 and \nvitamin D were measured on the 1st and 28th days of chemotherapy. Statistical \nanalyses included Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and Spearman \ncorrelation.\nRESULTS: AML patients had significantly higher IL-6 (7.19 vs. 1.15 pg/mL; \np\u2009=\u20090.00001) and lower ADAMTS13 (684 vs. 1205 ng/mL; p\u2009=\u20090.001) compared to \ncontrols. ADAMTS13 significantly increased by Day 28 (p\u2009=\u20090.0001), while IL-6 \nshowed no overall change. However, among vitamin D-deficient patients receiving \nsupplementation, IL-6 levels decreased significantly by Day 28 (p\u2009=\u20090.049). A \nnegative correlation was found between vitamin D and IL-6 on Day 28 (r\u2009=\u2009-0.485; \np\u2009=\u20090.035). No significant effect of vitamin D status was observed on ADAMTS13 \nlevels.\nCONCLUSION: Vitamin D supplementation was associated with a reduction in IL-6 \nlevels, but did not influence ADAMTS13 levels in patients with AML. These \nfindings support the potential role of vitamin D as an adjunct anti-inflammatory \nagent during induction chemotherapy. Further studies with larger samples and \nlonger follow-up are recommended to clarify its therapeutic relevance.
