In veterinary dermatology, historical \npatterns may alter a clinician's diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations. \nVeterinary patient reporting has similarities to reporting in human pediatric \nmedicine, in which clinician history is collected from caretakers instead of \npatients themselves. Informant discrepancy between medical histories taken from \nco-parents has been observed in human pediatric medicine but has not been \nassessed in veterinary medicine.\nOBJECTIVE: The objective of this questionnaire-based, prospective, descriptive \nstudy was to investigate informant agreement among caretakers of veterinary \ndermatology patients.\nPARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE: A caretaker history questionnaire was designed to \nassess the primary concern of the caretaker, seasonality and duration of \nclinical signs, pruritus score, areas of the body affected, dietary history, and \nmedication history. At initial dermatology consultations, caretakers completed \nthe questionnaire in separate rooms, as anonymized pairs. Agreement proportion \nwas analyzed by calculating the proportion of pairs, among all pairs, in which \nboth caretakers agreed.\nRESULTS: Fifty-three paired responses (106 caretakers) volunteered for the \nstudy. Agreement was highest for histories of gastrointestinal signs (94.1%), \nskin disease exacerbation by diet (84.3%), and duration of disease (80.4%). \nCaretakers reported pruritus visual analogue scores within 2 score units of one \nanother for 61.5% of patients. \"Individual affected body part\" agreement and \n\"individual protein consumed\" agreement proportions were 53.5 and 55.7%, \nrespectively. The lowest agreement was seen for seasonality of disease (38.5%) \nand individual medication use (38.7%).\nCONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our findings supported the concept that \ninformant discrepancy exists between caretaker histories reported in veterinary \ndermatology, suggesting that all caretakers' histories should be taken into \nconsideration.\n\nPublisher: Divergence des informations recueillies entre les soignants dans la \ncollecte des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents m\u00e9dicaux en dermatologie v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire.\nCONTEXTE: Le recueil des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents m\u00e9dicaux est essentiel \u00e0 la prise de \nd\u00e9cisions cliniques \u00e9clair\u00e9es en m\u00e9decine v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire.

Recent advances in \nregenerative medicine and artificial intelligence (AI) have reshaped the field \nof cosmetic dermatology, shifting the focus from temporary aesthetic \nimprovements to long-term interventions aimed at preserving skin vitality and \nlongevity.\nAIM: This narrative review aims to synthesize emerging knowledge from 2010 to \n2025 on the integration of regenerative strategies, biological modulators, \nimmunologic regulation, microbiome modulation, and AI-driven personalization in \nthe context of aesthetic longevity. The review also discusses translational \npotential and ethical considerations surrounding these advancements.\nMETHODS: A targeted literature search was conducted using PubMed and Scopus to \nidentify peer-reviewed articles from 2010 to 2025. Search terms included \"skin \naging,\" \"stem cells,\" \"mitochondrial dysfunction,\" \"epigenetic reprogramming,\" \n\"artificial intelligence in dermatology,\" and \"skin microbiome.\" Selected \nstudies focused on regenerative and longevity-based interventions with clinical \nrelevance or future applicability in cosmetic dermatology.\nRESULTS: Key findings were categorized into six interconnected domains: \nregenerative medicine, mitochondrial function, epigenetic modulation, \nimmunological balance, microbiome resilience, and AI-driven innovation. These \npillars demonstrate a paradigm shift toward biologically informed, personalized \nstrategies that aim to restore and sustain skin health at the molecular level.\nCONCLUSION: Cosmetic dermatology is undergoing a transformation toward \nintegrative, proactive care that combines regenerative medicine, AI, and \npersonalized interventions. These approaches offer promising, evidence-based \nsolutions for enhancing both aesthetic outcomes and long-term skin function, \nwhile also raising important ethical and regulatory considerations for clinical \nimplementation.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

However, dermatology \neducation is often underrepresented in medical curricula, particularly in low- \nand middle-income countries (LMICs) like Sudan. This study aimed to evaluate the \nimpact of a short dermatology course on final-year medical students' knowledge \nand confidence, with the aim of informing curriculum development in Sudan.\nMETHODS: A mixed-methods interventional study was conducted with 50 final-year \nmedical students at a public university in Khartoum, Sudan. Participants \nunderwent a 15-hour dermatology course, covering essential knowledge and \ndiagnostic skills tailored to the local disease burden. Pre- and post-course \nassessments were administered using a self-administered structured \nquestionnaire. Quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS, and qualitative data \nfrom a focus group discussion were analyzed using an inductive open-coding \napproach.\nRESULTS: The study found significant improvements in participants' knowledge and \ndiagnostic skills. Knowledge increased from an average of 48.2-83.4% \n(p\u2009<\u20090.001), and diagnostic skills improved from 54.6 to 90.2% (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The \ncourse notably enhanced students' ability to identify fungal infections, \nmalignant lesions, and dermatologic emergencies. Focus group discussions \nrevealed high satisfaction with the course's content, structure, and delivery, \nwith students expressing increased confidence in managing dermatologic \nconditions during clinical practice.\nCONCLUSION: A short dermatology course significantly improved knowledge and \ndiagnostic confidence among final-year medical students in Sudan. Given the \nlimited dermatology exposure in undergraduate curricula, such targeted \neducational interventions can bridge knowledge gaps and better prepare students \nfor clinical practice in resource-limited settings. Future studies should \nexplore long-term retention and practical skill assessment to further strengthen \ndermatology education.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

However, under the traditional learning model, medical students \nlack a dynamic understanding of skin lesions and clinical diagnosis and \ntreatment procedures.\nMETHODS: This study proposes the dynamic case-based learning (DCBL) model, which \nwas presented through typical dynamic cases. We surveyed 129 undergraduate \nstudents and 53 clinical dermatologists to gain an understanding of perceptions \nof the DCBL model.\nRESULTS: Eighty percent of students felt very satisfied or satisfied with the \nDCBL model. They self-evaluated that the new model would greatly improve their \nattention (92.2%), learning interest (89.9%), self-directed learning ability \n(89.9%), dynamic understanding of lesions (96.9%), and ability to diagnose and \ntreat skin diseases (95.4%). Additionally, a significant proportion of teachers \nalso believed that students could improve across multiple dimensions, including \nself-directed learning ability (96.2%) and dynamic understanding of skin lesions \n(98.1%).\nCONCLUSION: Most clinical dermatologists and students participating in this \nstudy expressed a positive attitude towards the DCBL model. According to their \nperceived responses, the model appears to effectively stimulate the enthusiasm \nof students for learning, enhance their dynamic understanding of skin diseases, \nhelp them to train diagnostic and therapeutic thinking, and improve their \ndiagnosis and treatment skills. However, further empirical research is required \nto directly assess its impact on the enhancement of diagnostic and treatment \nabilities in dermatology, as well as its overall effectiveness.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Results showed a better performance in the \nFree Answer format, as opposed to Multiple Choice. Furthermore, adding patient \ndata to the input images did not improve accuracy. These findings suggest that \nwhile ChatGPT-4o can serve as a second-opinion tool in dermatological education, \nit can do so by supporting, not replacing, the critical thinking process the \nstudents should perform when exercising diagnostic capabilities.

The accuracy and reliability of the chatbot's \noutputs were compared against established references for 43 interactions.\nRESULTS: ChatGPT-4o successfully identified all evaluated interactions. It \naccurately described the interaction effects in 42 cases, with only one example \nof misdescription.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the potential of ChatGPT to serve as an \neffective and efficient alternative for identifying and understanding DDIs in \ndermatology, despite one noted error that emphasizes the need for ongoing \nverification against trusted references.

Descriptive analysis was conducted to quantify the proportion \nof appropriately and inappropriately assigned urgency in priority populations of \nwomen, M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples and paediatric patients.\nRESULTS: One-third of general dermatology referrals, and nearly one in six \nreferrals of suspected skin cancers, had an inappropriately assigned urgency. A \nquarter of general dermatology and most melanoma referrals had urgency lower \nthan triage priority. M\u0101ori and Pacific patients were under-represented in the \nproportion of referrals received by ethnicity when comparing to national and \nprovincial population estimates. However, no significant disparities in \nappropriateness of urgency across ethnicity were observed, and the same was seen \nfor female and paediatric patients.\nCONCLUSION: Our study adds to the limited research on the appropriateness of \nreferrer-rated urgency.

Incidence in \nthe United States has been reported around 4 occurrences per million people per \nyear. Local recurrences have been reported between 2 to 19% of cases. These \ncases are at higher risk for sarcomatous transformation, increasing the risk for \nmetastasis. Early and accurate diagnosis, coupled with appropriate management, \nis essential to minimize these risks. However, early on, DFSP is often \nmisdiagnosed as a number of benign subcutaneous growths. Misdiagnosis often \nleads to incorrect or delayed treatment. This study extends previous research by \nevaluating whether access to dermatology care influences DFSP treatment outcomes \nin a larger cohort and larger geographical area.\nMETHODS: This study is a retrospective review currently including 68 adults with \nhistologically confirmed DFSP. The study evaluated three endpoints: rates of \nappropriate workup and diagnosis comparing dermatology and non-dermatology \nproviders, rates of appropriate primary treatment between lesions with and \nwithout appropriate workup and diagnosis, and rates of positive margins or \nprimary recurrence between lesions without and with appropriate primary \ntreatment.\nRESULTS: For all three endpoints, the data rejected the null hypothesis.\nCONCLUSION: These findings further support that early biopsy and high clinical \nsuspicion for DFSP improve surgical outcomes, particularly when diagnostic \nbiopsy is performed prior to treatment. The larger sample size reinforces the \nimportance of dermatology access in optimizing patient care and decreasing \nmorbidity from DFSP treatment. Increased clinical awareness and stricter \nadherence to diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines are recommended for improved \npatient outcomes in the management of DFSP.\n\nCopyright\u00a9 South Dakota State Medical Association.\n\nPMID: 40550169 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n10.

This scoping review aimed to assess \nthe emerging applications of AI use in the context of chronic, non-neoplastic \ndermatologic diseases.\nMETHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed and SCOPUS were searched on August 11, 2023 \nusing variations of the search concepts \"dermatology,\" \"artificial \nintelligence,\" and 12 common chronic dermatologic conditions. Article screening \nand data extraction were completed, and each study was categorized into themes \nand conditions.\nRESULTS: A total of 224 unique studies were included. The most prevalent \nconditions that were studied in the context of AI included psoriasis (n = 67), \natopic dermatitis/eczema (n = 41) and acne (n = 36). The majority of AI \napplications involved clinical evaluation (n = 176), images (analysis, \ngeneration or segmentation) (n = 163) and data analysis (n = 46). Clinical \nevaluation was further divided into 2 subthemes: diagnosis (n = 104) and disease \nassessment (n = 67). Diagnostic and analytic applications of AI are limited by \nthe training datasets available (quantity of training data, image quality) and \ninsufficient diagnostic information provided (eg, the patient's reported history \nof their lesion, disease/symptom onset and risk factors).\nCONCLUSIONS: Common applications of AI are predominantly as an automated \ndiagnostic tool for evaluating disease severity/characteristics, while niche and \nnovel applications were explored further. However, recognizing the limitations \nof technology is critical prior to the widespread application of AI in \ndermatological practice. The insights from the current study can inform clinical \nadoption of AI in dermatology, and highlight research gaps to guide future \nacademic initiatives.\n\nDOI: 10.1177/12034754241308237\nPMCID: PMC12171080\nPMID: 40542698 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe \nauthor(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the \nresearch, authorship and/or publication of this article: Dr. Ilya Mukovozov has \nparticipated in advisory boards for Catalytic Health Inc, L\u2019Oreal Canada, RBC \nConsultants and Sun Pharmaceuticals; received honoraria for speaking engagement \nfrom AbbVie and Sun Pharmaceuticals.

However, the U.S. healthcare sector is \nparadoxically a significant contributor to climate change-worsening greenhouse \ngas emissions. To address this negative externality, calls to action to \ndecarbonize healthcare delivery have spurred research and initiatives around \nimproving the environmental sustainability of medicine. Published sustainability \nrecommendations for dermatologic practices have addressed themes such as \nrenewable energy, single-use disposable materials, regulated medical waste, and \nclinician advocacy. Our current commentary provides an analysis of the potential \nof existing recommendations and outlines additional, novel, and actionable \ninterventions. We highlight recently released decarbonization resources and \nregulatory changes. We emphasize the importance of reassessing procedure kits, \nminimizing medication waste, and implementing green procurement policies. We \nalso address nuances in promoting environmentally-conscious transit, maximizing \nthe efficient use of technology, supporting alternatives to single-use items, \nleveraging resources for patient education, assessing appropriate use of carbon \ncredits, and bolstering community climate resilience.\n\nDOI: 10.5070/D330664683\nPMID: 40526953 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n13.

Its \nonset is closely associated with insulin resistance, insufficient compensatory \nfunction of \u03b2 - cells, and abnormal placental function. Epidemiological studies \nhave indicated that type 2 diabetes is an independent risk factor for breast \ncancer. However, the association between GDM and the risk of breast cancer \nremains controversial.\nOBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to comprehensively \nevaluate the association between GDM and the risk of breast cancer and explore \nits underlying mechanisms.\nMETHODS: This study systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, \nEMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases, covering the period from \nestablishing each database until April 14, 2025. Two researchers extracted \nrelevant data and assessed the quality of included studies using the \nNewcastle-Ottawa Scale. The study evaluated inter-study heterogeneity using the \nI\u00b2 statistic. Based on the magnitude of heterogeneity, fixed-effect or \nrandom-effect models were employed to calculate the pooled hazard ratio (HR) and \nits corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Additionally, subgroup analyses, \nsensitivity analyses, funnel plot analyses, and publication bias assessments \nwere performed. All data analyses were conducted using STATA 17 software.\nRESULTS: The overall analysis revealed no significant association between GDM \nand breast cancer risk (HR=1.03, 95%CI: 0.92-1.15). However, subgroup analysis \nrevealed significant regional heterogeneity: within the regional subgroups, \nNorth American results showed an association between GDM and a reduced breast \ncancer risk (HR=0.89, 95%CI: 0.84-0.95), whereas Asian findings suggested an \nassociation with an increased risk (HR=1.23, 95%CI: 1.15-1.31). No significant \nassociations were observed in subgroups based on study design \n(cohort/case-control) or follow-up duration (short-term/long-term). Sensitivity \nanalysis demonstrated robust results, and there was no publication bias in this \nstudy.\nCONCLUSION: In summary, there is no significant association between GDM and \nbreast cancer risk overall. However, notable regional heterogeneity exists: in \nthe North American subgroup, GDM is associated with a reduced risk of breast \ncancer, while in the Asian subgroup, GDM is significantly associated with an \nincreased risk of breast cancer.\nSYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/, identifier \nCRD420251032589.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Li, Li, Jin, Zhang, Li, Xu, Wang, Hu, Wang and Yu.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fendo.2025.1621932\nPMCID: PMC12267041\nPMID: 40678319 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n14.

Genetic analysis of IP is \ncomplicated by a homologous pseudogene, making conventional short-read \nsequencing challenging. While long-range PCR is typically used to overcome this, \nskewed X-inactivation detection can also aid in assigning variants to IKBKG. We \nemployed a comprehensive approach, incorporating whole-exome sequencing (WES), \nlong-range PCR, RT-PCR, X-inactivation analysis, and nanopore sequencing, to \nidentify and accurately phase a small heterozygous deletion, NM_001099857.5: \nc.363_367del, p.(Leu122Glyfs\u2063\u221714), in the IKBKG gene in an IP-affected family. \nThe deletion was initially detected via WES, with skewed X-inactivation observed \nin both the proband and her mother. Long-range PCR specific to IKBKG confirmed \nthe variant's location in the IKBKG gene, not in the pseudogene. On the RNA \nlevel, the variant was undetectable, suggesting nonsense-mediated decay of the \ntranscript. Nanopore sequencing precisely mapped the variant to IKBKG and \nanalyzed the methylation status of both alleles, confirming the skewed \nX-inactivation, with the variant-carrying allele predominantly inactivated. This \ndemonstrates the nanopore sequencing's value in genetic diagnosis, enabling \nprecise variant localization and analysis of X chromosome activation status in \nfemales with skewed X-inactivation, aiding in accurate diagnosis and \nunderstanding of IP.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Simone Ahting et al.

We present a case of rapidly progressive, refractory SSc \nwith cardiac, musculoskeletal, and skin manifestations that was successfully \nmanaged with a combination of cyclophosphamide (CYC) and tocilizumab (TCZ). In \nthis case, a 25-year-old female patient with rapidly progressive SSc developed \nsevere skin sclerosis (mRSS 46), myofascial edema, myopathy (CK 923 U/L), joint \nflexion contractures, and pericardial effusion. Initial therapy with \nglucocorticoids and CYC showed limited efficacy. After therapeutic escalation to \nan alternating 4-week regimen (TCZ 8 mg/kg and CYC 600 mg administered \nsequentially every 2 weeks), pericardial effusion resolved completely, skin \nsoftening was observed (mRSS reduced to 32), and functional status improved \nsignificantly, with no significant adverse events reported. This case highlights \nthe potential efficacy and safety of the CYC-TCZ combination therapy for \nrefractory SSc, particularly in patients with cardiac involvement. These \nfindings support the need for further exploration of this regimen in clinical \ntrials.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Fu, Ji, Cheng, Shi, Mo and Yang.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1614714\nPMCID: PMC12267156\nPMID: 40677713 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n16.

Patients were \ndivided into an infection group (70 cases) and a non-infection group (74 cases) \nbased on the presence of infection. The infection group was further categorized \ninto mild (29 cases), moderate (18 cases), and severe infection (23 cases) \nsubgroups according to infection severity. Serum levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and \nIFN-\u03b3 in DFI patients were analyzed, and their predictive value for treatment \noutcomes was evaluated.\nRESULTS: Serum levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b3 were significantly higher in the \ninfection group than in the non-infection group (P<0.05). Moreover, there were \nsignificant differences in TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b3 levels among patients with \nmild, moderate, and severe infections (P<0.05). ROC curve analysis demonstrated \nthat the area under the curve (AUC) for the combined detection of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, \nand IFN-\u03b3 in assessing DFI severity was 0.855, which was significantly higher \nthan that of TNF-\u03b1 (0.811), IL-6 (0.793), and IFN-\u03b3 (0.764) (P<0.05). \nFurthermore, serum levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b3 were significantly higher in \nthe poor prognosis group than in the good prognosis group (P<0.05). ROC curve \nanalysis showed that the AUC for predicting poor prognosis in DFI patients was \n0.926 when TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b3 were combined, which was significantly higher \nthan that of TNF-\u03b1 (0.849), IL-6 (0.834), and IFN-\u03b3 (0.809) (P<0.05).\nCONCLUSION: Serum levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b3 are elevated in DFI patients \nand are closely associated with infection severity and prognosis. The combined \ndetection of these three inflammatory factors can serve as a predictive \nindicator for infection severity and poor prognosis in DFI patients.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Wang, Gao, Qin, Li, Wang and Xie.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fcimb.2025.1606612\nPMCID: PMC12267273\nPMID: 40677522 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n17.

Methods: A total of 4 832 patients \nwith type 2 diabetes mellitus from 60 surveillance sites in 11 provinces where \nnational surveillance for chronic diseases and risk factors was conducted in \n2010 were selected as the study participants, and a follow-up survey was \nconducted in 3 516 persons from 2016 to 2017, finally 3 427 patients were \nincluded in the analysis after excluding those data exception and incomplete \ndata. Cox proportional risk regression model was used to evalaute the \nassociation between HbA1c level and the risk for diabetes complications \n(macroangiopathy, microangiopathy and diabetic foot), and subgroup analyses were \nconducted according to the baseline characteristics of the study participants, \nsuch as age, gender and smoking status. Results: A total of 3 427 study \nparticipants were included in final analysis of the follow up for an average of \n6.2 years, in whom 395 suffered from macroangiopathy, 226 suffered from \nmicroangiopathy, and 57 suffered from diabetic foot later during the follow-up \nperiod. After adjusting for relevant confounders, using the HbA1c <7.0% as a \nreference, there was no increased risk for macrovascular lesions in the those \nwith HbA1c levels of 7.0%-, 7.5%-, 8.0%-8.4%, and the risk for macrovascular \nlesions increased by 38% in those with HbA1c \u22658.5% (HR=1.38,95%CI:1.06-1.80); \nthe risk for microangiopathies increased by 131% (HR=2.31,95%CI:1.46-3.65), \n206%(HR=3.06,95%CI:1.91-4.90) and 208% (HR=3.08,95%CI:2.20-4.30) in those with \nHbA1c levels of 7.5%-, 8.0%-, \u22658.5%, respectively; and the risk for diabetic \nfoot increased by 253% (HR=3.53, 95%CI: 1.89-6.59) in those with HbA1c level \n\u22658.5%. Subgroup analyses revealed an effect modifying effect of different \ndiabetes diagnosis situations (previously diagnosed and newly diagnosed) on \nHbA1c level and the risk for microangiopathy. Conclusions: HbA1c level \u22657.5% \nwould increase the risk for microangiopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes \nmellitus, the higher the level, the higher the risk, and HbA1c level \u22658.5% would \nincrease the risk for macrovascular lesions and diabetic foot. It is necessary \nto strengthen the health education in diabetic patients to improve their \nawareness of blood glucose management and the importance of HbA1c level control \nto effectively reduce or delay the diabetes complications.\n\nPublisher: \u76ee\u7684\uff1a \u63a2\u8ba8\u4e2d\u56fd11\u4e2a\u77012\u578b\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u7cd6\u5316\u8840\u7ea2\u86cb\u767d\uff08HbA1c\uff09\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0e\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u5e76\u53d1\u75c7\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002 \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a \n\u9009\u53d62010\u5e74\u4e2d\u56fd\u6162\u6027\u75c5\u53ca\u5176\u5371\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u76d1\u6d4b11\u4e2a\u770160\u4e2a\u76d1\u6d4b\u70b9\u4e2d4 832\u540d2\u578b\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u4e8e2016-2017\u5e74\u8fdb\u884c\u968f\u8bbf\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u968f\u8bbf3 \n516\u540d\uff0c\u6392\u9664\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u5e38\u6216\u7f3a\u5931\u7b49\u60c5\u51b5\u540e\uff0c\u51713 \n427\u540d\u7eb3\u5165\u5206\u6790\u3002\u91c7\u7528Cox\u6bd4\u4f8b\u98ce\u9669\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30HbA1c\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0e\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u5e76\u53d1\u75c7\uff08\u5927\u8840\u7ba1\u75c5\u53d8\u3001\u5fae\u8840\u7ba1\u75c5\u53d8\u548c\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u8db3\uff09\u53d1\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5e76\u6309\u7167\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u6027\u522b\u3001\u5438\u70df\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u4e9a\u7ec4\u5206\u6790\u3002 \n\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a \u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u8c61\u51713 \n427\u540d\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u968f\u8bbf6.2\u5e74\uff0c\u968f\u8bbf\u671f\u95f4395\u540d\u53d1\u751f\u5927\u8840\u7ba1\u75c5\u53d8\uff0c226\u540d\u53d1\u751f\u5fae\u8840\u7ba1\u75c5\u53d8\uff0c57\u540d\u53d1\u751f\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u8db3\u3002\u8c03\u6574\u76f8\u5173\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\u540e\uff0c\u4ee5HbA1c<7.0%\u7ec4\u4e3a\u53c2\u7167\uff0cHbA1c\u6c34\u5e737.0%~\u30017.5%~\u30018.0%~8.4%\u7ec4\u5927\u8840\u7ba1\u75c5\u53d8\u53d1\u751f\u98ce\u9669\u672a\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u22658.5%\u7ec4\u5927\u8840\u7ba1\u75c5\u53d8\u53d1\u751f\u98ce\u9669\u589e\u52a038%\uff08HR=1.38\uff0c95%CI\uff1a1.06~1.80\uff09\uff1bHbA1c\u6c34\u5e737.5%~\u30018.0%~\u3001\u22658.5%\u7ec4\u5fae\u8840\u7ba1\u75c5\u53d8\u53d1\u751f\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u522b\u589e\u52a0131%\uff08HR=2.31\uff0c95%CI\uff1a1.46~3.65\uff09\u3001206%\uff08HR=3.06\uff0c95%CI\uff1a1.91~4.90\uff09\u548c208%\uff08HR=3.08\uff0c95%CI\uff1a2.20~4.30\uff09\uff1bHbA1c\u22658.5%\u7ec4\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u8db3\u53d1\u751f\u98ce\u9669\u589e\u52a0253%\uff08HR=3.53\uff0c95%CI\uff1a1.89~6.59\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u7ec4\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u8db3\u53d1\u751f\u98ce\u9669\u672a\u89c1\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u4e9a\u7ec4\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u60c5\u51b5\uff08\u65e2\u5f80\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u65b0\u8bca\u65ad\uff09\u5bf9HbA1c\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0e\u5fae\u8840\u7ba1\u75c5\u53d8\u53d1\u751f\u98ce\u9669\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u5e94\u4fee\u9970\u4f5c\u7528\u3002 \n\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a \nHbA1c\u22657.5%\u4f1a\u589e\u52a02\u578b\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u5fae\u8840\u7ba1\u75c5\u53d8\u7684\u53d1\u751f\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e14\u53d1\u751f\u98ce\u9669\u968fHbA1c\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u5347\u9ad8\u800c\u589e\u52a0\uff1bHbA1c\u22658.5%\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u5927\u8840\u7ba1\u75c5\u53d8\u548c\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u8db3\u7684\u53d1\u751f\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u5e94\u52a0\u5f3a\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u6559\u80b2\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8840\u7cd6\u7ba1\u7406\u610f\u8bc6\uff0c\u5c3d\u91cf\u5c06HbA1c\u63a7\u5236\u5728\u8f83\u4f4e\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u6216\u5ef6\u7f13\u5e76\u53d1\u75c7\u7684\u53d1\u751f\u3002.\n\nDOI: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20250127-00065\nPMID: 40677178 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n18.

This study aims to characterize JDM from an \nOmani national cohort, evaluating clinical manifestations, laboratory features, \ndisease course, and treatment outcomes.\nMETHODS: A retrospective review of all JDM patients diagnosed and managed by \npediatric rheumatologist in tertiary centers in Oman was conducted. Patient \ndemographics, clinical features, laboratory findings, treatment modalities, and \ndisease outcomes were analyzed.\nRESULTS: A total of 30 children diagnosed with JDM were included. They had an \nequal female to male distribution, 1:1 ratio. The median age at disease onset \nwas 6.78 years (range: 2-13), with a median diagnostic delay of 8.4 months \n(range:1-23). The median follow-up period for these patients was 4 years \n(absolute range: 1 month-16 years). Classic JDM skin manifestations, including \nheliotrope rash (n\u2009=\u200925; 83%) and Gottron's papules (n\u2009=\u200923; 77%), were common. \nProximal muscle weakness was observed in 28 (93%) patients, while 23 (77%) \npatients exhibited elevated muscle enzymes. MRI findings consistent with \nmyositis were present in 70% (n\u2009=\u200919/27) of the subjects, and muscle biopsy \nconfirmed JDM in 9 cases (30%). Among 25 patients tested for myositis specific \nantibodies, NXP2 (n\u2009=\u20093), Anti-TIF1 (n\u2009=\u20092), Anti-Mi-2 (n\u2009=\u20091), and MDA5 (n\u2009=\u20091) \nwere detected, showing expected correlations with disease phenotype. \nCorticosteroids were universally administered, with methotrexate (n\u2009=\u200925; 83%) \nand IVIG (n\u2009=\u200915; 50%) as common adjuncts. Calcinosis was observed in 8 patients \n(27%), and was managed with various treatment modalities including pamidronate \n(n\u2009=\u20093), diltiazem (n\u2009=\u20092), and infliximab (n\u2009=\u20091). At the last follow-up, 18 \npatients (60%) were in clinical remission, 50% (n\u2009=\u200915) followed a polyphasic or \nchronic disease course, and 2 patients succumbed to disease-related \ncomplications.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study provides comprehensive characterization of pediatric JDM \nin Oman. The findings highlight regional variations in disease presentation, \nautoantibody profiles, and treatment responses, underscoring the need for early \ndiagnosis and individualized management strategies. Continued follow-up is \nessential to optimize long-term outcomes and improve survival rates in this \npatient population.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Pistachio waste is recognized for its health benefits, particularly \nfor its anticancer properties. This study assessed the phytochemical \ncharacteristics of pistachio hull (PH) and shell (PS) using various solvents \n(ethyl acetate, hexane, and methanol). Methanolic extracts showed substantially \nhigher phenolic and flavonoid contents along with enhanced antioxidant activity \nacross all tested methods, with PH consistently outperforming PS in antioxidant \nproperties. Cell viability tests on MCF-7 cancer cells indicated that PH-Hexane \nhad a slightly greater effect than PH-ethyl acetate and PH-methanol. Cell cycle \nanalysis revealed a notable arrest in the G0/G1 phase compared to the control \ngroup. Additionally, PH-Hexane treatment resulted in 21.24% apoptosis, primarily \nearly apoptosis at 19.41%. The pathway analysis involving 46 genes revealed that \nPH-Hexane induces apoptosis in MCF-7 cancer cells by modulating several \nmetabolic pathways, particularly those associated with the immune system, \ndevelopmental biology, signal transduction, and cellular responses to stimuli. \nThis induction was characterized by the substantial upregulation of the CEBPB, \nHIF1A, and MYC genes and the significant downregulation of ATF2, CEBPA, and \nNR3C1 genes. The findings of this study indicate that the hexane extract derived \nfrom high-oil-content wastes has potential as an anticancer agent. Future \nresearch on oil-rich plant-based wastes should consider utilizing hexane as a \nsolvent for further exploration of anticancer properties.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Recent reports have \nsuggested new roles for gamma delta (\u03b3\u03b4) T-cells in addition to immune \nsurveillance, however, it remains to be determined whether the mechanisms \nidentified in psoriasis murine models have a similar role in humans. The aim of \nthe present study was to investigate the relationship between IL-17\u00a0A mRNA \nexpression levels and \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell frequency in human psoriatic lesions, and to \nclarify the potential role of \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells in psoriasis pathogenesis.\nMETHODS: The study involved 20 patients diagnosed with psoriasis and 16 control \nsubjects. Expression of the IL-17\u00a0A gene was measured in formalin-fixed \nparaffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues by RT-PCR method. TCR\u03b3\u03b4+ immunofluorescence \nstaining was performed to measure the distribution of \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells in the same \nsamples.\nRESULTS: In psoriatic lesion biopsies, TCR\u03b3\u03b4+ T-cell percentage was found higher \nthan the control samples. Additionally, psoriasis patients exhibited elevated \nlevels of IL-17\u00a0A gene expression. In addition, this study showed a weak \nnegative correlation between the proportion of \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells and IL-17\u00a0A mRNA \nexpression in psoriatic skin samples.\nCONCLUSION: A weak negative correlation between IL-17\u00a0A mRNA levels and \u03b3\u03b4 \nT-cell presence in human psoriasis lesions highlighting the novel effector \nfunctions of these cells in psoriasis pathogenesis.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Genetic testing revealed a pathogenic mutation in the \nserine/threonine protein kinase 11 (STK11) gene c.843del frameshift variant \n(p.L282Sfs*5), characterized by guanine deletion at position 843 resulting in \nleucine-to-serine substitution at residue 282, complete alteration of downstream \namino acid sequence, and premature translation termination. In addition, she \nalso presented with MCDK.\nCONCLUSION: This case reveals a potential novel role of STK11 in renal \nembryogenesis, expanding its phenotypic spectrum and challenging the \nconventional paradigm that STK11 mutations solely confer tumor predisposition. \nThrough comprehensive literature review, we propose three mechanistic hypotheses \n- \"metabolo-developmental coupling disruption\", \"ciliopathy-like pathogenesis\", \nand \"epigenetic modulation of developmental plasticity\" - providing new \nmolecular insights into congenital renal anomalies. These findings warrant \nsystematic renal evaluation in PJS patients and exploration of \nmetabolism-targeted therapeutic strategies.\nCLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

We analyzed \nthe serum metabolites and gut microbial composition in 20 patients with \nneurogenic rosacea and 14 healthy controls. Metabolomic analysis identified 56 \ndifferentially abundant metabolites (DAMs), with benzene and substituted \nderivatives, carboxylic acids and derivatives, and organophosphates being among \nthe most enriched categories. Gut microbiota analysis revealed significant \ndysbiosis in patients with neurogenic rosacea, characterized by an increased \nabundance of Lachnospiraceae, Veillonellaceae, and Clostridiaceae, and decreased \nlevels of Prevotellaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae. Spearman's correlation analysis \ndemonstrated significant relationships between specific serum metabolites and \ngut microbial taxa, including strong positive correlations between \n3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and both Bifidobacterium (r\u2009=\u20090.7307, \npadj\u2009=\u20099.25e-07) and Lactobacillus (r\u2009=\u20090.6898, padj\u2009=\u20096.39e-06). These findings \nhighlight the complex interactions between metabolic dysregulation and gut \nmicrobial imbalances in neurogenic rosacea, suggesting a potential role for the \ngut-skin axis in its pathophysiology. This study paves the way for future \ntherapeutic strategies targeting both metabolic and microbial dysbiosis to \nmanage neurogenic rosacea.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Incorporating these agents into \nneoadjuvant/adjuvant treatment regimens for early-stage cancers may provide \nhealth and economic benefits at the population level.\nMETHODS: A health outcomes projection model compared two scenarios in \nSwitzerland: I) anti-PD-(L)1 agents used only for advanced/metastatic disease, \nand II) anti-PD-(L)1 agents starting in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting. The \nmodel focused on three cancers for which anti-PD-(L)1 agents are currently \napproved in Europe in early stages: melanoma, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and \ntriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), projecting clinical evolution over 10 \nyears. Estimated outcomes included life-years, quality-adjusted life-years \n(QALYs), recurrences/events, active treatments for metastatic disease, adverse \nevents, and deaths.\nRESULTS: Of the estimated 10,659 eligible patients during 2022-2031, 9,050 were \npredicted to initiate neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant treatment with anti-PD-(L)1 \nagents for treatment of melanoma, RCC, or TNBC. Compared to anti-PD-(L)1 agents \nbeing available only in the metastatic setting, use of anti-PD-(L)1 agents in \nthe neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant setting for these 3 cancers was projected to \navoid 1,144 recurrences (a 27% decrease), prevent 1,577 active treatments in the \nmetastatic setting (a 35% decrease), avoid 530 deaths (a 23% decrease), and \nincrease life-years without recurrence by 3,416 (a 10% increase).\nCONCLUSION: The use of anti-PD(L)1 agents to treat early-stage cancers in \nSwitzerland is anticipated to result in better outcomes by preventing \nrecurrences/events, active metastatic treatments, and deaths.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Favre-Bulle, Stankovi\u0107, Mantaian, Frei, Schaefer, Gabriel, \nS\u00f6nmez and Aguiar-Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1601377\nPMCID: PMC12267198\nPMID: 40677709 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: AF-B, MS, CF, SS, and SG are employees of MSD \nSwitzerland, a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ, USA.

The prognostic relevance of MMRN2 expression level was \nassessed using Cox regression and \"timeROC\". The correlations of MMRN2 \nexpression level with immune infiltration and angiogenesis-related genes were \nanalyzed using GSCA database and the ssGSEA algorithm. Colony-forming assay, \nTranswell assay, and wound healing assay were used to examine the changes in \nproliferation and migration of cultured cutaneous melanoma cells following MMRN2 \nknockdown. In a mouse model bearing cutaneous melanoma xenograft, the effect of \nMMRN2 knockdown on vital organ pathologies, survival of the mice and GM-CSF, \nCXCL9, and TGF\u2011\u03b21 protein expressions were analyzed.\nRESULTS: MMRN2 was significantly upregulated in metastatic cutaneous melanoma \n(P<0.001). Protein interaction network analysis identified 15 intersecting \ngenes, which were enriched in endothelium development and cell-cell junctions. \nIn patients with cutaneous melanoma, a high MMRN2 expression was correlated with \na poor prognosis, an advanced T stage, a greater Breslow depth, and ulceration \n(P<0.05). MMRN2 expression level was strongly correlated with 24 immune cell \ntypes (P<0.001), fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and expressions of the \npro-angiogenic genes (KCNJ8, SLCO2A1, NRP1, and COL3A1; P<0.001). In cultured \nB16F10 cells, MMRN2 knockdown significantly suppressed cell proliferation, \nmigration and invasion and caused remo-deling of the immunosuppressive \nmicroenvironment.\nCONCLUSIONS: MMRN2 overexpression drives progression of cutaneous melanoma by \nenhancing tumor metastasis, angiogenesis and immune evasion, highlighting its \npotential as a therapeutic target for melanomas.\n\nPublisher: \u76ee\u7684: \u91c7\u7528\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u63a2\u8ba8\u591a\u805a\u86cb\u767d-2\uff08MMRN2\uff09\u6291\u5236\u76ae\u80a4\u9ed1\u8272\u7d20\u7624\uff08SKCM\uff09\u751f\u957f\u548c\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5: \n\u4eceGEO\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u83b7\u5f97SKCM\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6b63\u5e38\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u9ed1\u8272\u7d20\u7624\u4e2dMMRN2\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7STRING\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u83b7\u5f97\u548cMMRN2\u4e92\u76f8\u4f5c\u7528\u86cb\u767d\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u86cb\u767d\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5229\u7528GEPIA2.0\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e0b\u8f7dSKCM\u4e2dMMRN2\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u57fa\u56e0\uff0c\u5bf9\u4ea4\u96c6\u57fa\u56e0\u8fdb\u884cGO/KEGG\u529f\u80fd\u5bcc\u96c6\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u201ctimeROC\u201d\u5305\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u201cstats\u201d\u5305\u548c\u201ccar\u201d\u5305\uff0c\u5206\u6790MMRN2\u548cSKCM\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528survival\u5305\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u4f8b\u98ce\u9669\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884cCox\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u7b5b\u9009\u72ec\u7acb\u9884\u540e\u56e0\u7d20\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e34\u5e8a\u5217\u7ebf\u56fe\uff1b\u5229\u7528GSCA\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u548cssGSEA\u7b97\u6cd5\u5206\u6790MMRN2\u4e0e\u514d\u75ab\u7ec6\u80de\u6d78\u6da6\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b\u5229\u7528Spearman\u5206\u6790\u7814\u7a76MMRN2\u548c\u8840\u7ba1\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u5173\u57fa\u56e0\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b\u96c6\u843d\u514b\u9686\u3001transwell\u3001\u5212\u75d5\u5b9e\u9a8c\u68c0\u6d4bSKCM\u7ec6\u80de\u7684\u589e\u6b96\u548c\u8f6c\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u91c7\u7528HE\u67d3\u8272\u89c2\u5bdf\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u53d8\u5316\uff1bKaplan-Meier\u66f2\u7ebf\u89c2\u5bdf\u751f\u5b58\u65f6\u95f4\uff1bELISA\u5b9e\u9a8c\u68c0\u6d4b\u9ed1\u8272\u7d20\u7624\u7ec6\u80de\u4e0a\u6e05\u4e2dGM-CSF\u3001CXCL9\u3001TGF-\u03b21\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u7ed3\u679c: \nMMRN2\u5728SKCM\u8f6c\u79fb\u7624\u4e2d\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\u5347\u9ad8\uff08P<0.001\uff09\uff1b\u5728STRING\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f9730\u4e2a\u4e92\u4f5c\u5206\u5b50\u6784\u5efa\u86cb\u767d\u4e92\u4f5c\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u548cGEPIA2.0\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u57fa\u56e0\u53d6\u4ea4\u96c6\u5f97\u523015\u4e2a\u5171\u540c\u57fa\u56e0\uff0c\u8fdb\u884cGO/KEGG\u5206\u6790\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u662fendothelium \ndevelopment\u3001cell-cell junction\u7b49\u3002\u5728SKCM\u60a3\u8005\u4e2dMMRN2\u9ad8\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u9884\u540e\u66f4\u5dee\uff0cMMRN2\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\u5728pathologic T \nsatge\u3001breslow depth\u3001melanoma \nulceration\u4e2d\u5dee\u5f02\u5177\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08P<0.05\uff09\uff0c\u514d\u75ab\u6d78\u6da6\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cMMRN2\u548c24\u4e2d\u514d\u75ab\u7ec6\u80de\u4e30\u5ea6\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff08P<0.001\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u80bf\u7624\u6210\u7ea4\u7ef4\u7ec6\u80de\u548c\u5185\u76ae\u7ec6\u80de\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff08P<0.001\uff09\uff0cMMRN2\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u8840\u7ba1\u751f\u4ea7\u57fa\u56e0\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u6c34\u5e73\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u548cKCNJ8\u3001SLCO2A1\u3001NRP1\u3001COL3A1\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8f83\u5f3a\uff08P<0.001\uff09\uff1b\u6572\u4f4eMMRN2\u540e\uff0cSKCM\u7ec6\u80deB16F10\u7684\u589e\u6b96\uff08P<0.01\uff09\u3001\u4fb5\u88ad\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u51cf\u5f31\uff08P<0.01\uff09\uff0c\u91cd\u5851\u514d\u75ab\u5fae\u73af\u5883\uff08P<0.001\uff09\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u6291\u5236\u9ed1\u8272\u7d20\u7624\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba: \n\u591a\u805a\u86cb\u767d-2\u53ef\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u6cbb\u7597SKCM\u7684\u65b0\u9776\u70b9\uff0c\u4e3aSKCM\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u601d\u8def\u3002.\n\nDOI: 10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2025.07.14\nPMCID: PMC12268918\nPMID: 40673310 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n25.

The wide spread adoption of this procedure is however, hampered \nby the availability of the hand-held gamma probe.\nAIM: To demonstrate the safety and feasibility of sentinel node biopsy using \nmethylene blue and SPECT CT lymphoscintigraphy.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of the case records of all patients \nof breast cancer, penile cancer and melanomas who underwent surgery at our \nInstitute between December 2019 and November 2024 was analysed. Demographic \ndata, operative data, pathological reports and follow up data were analysed.\nRESULTS: Out of a total of 628 patients operated for the above cancers, 70 \npatients underwent a sentinel lymph node biopsy along with surgery for the \nprimary. Localization was possible in all the patients (100%). The time taken to \nlocalize the node decreased from 33\u00a0min to 16\u00a0min over the course of the \nlearning curve (percentage change of -50%). The median number of nodes isolated \nincreased by 200% and the seroma in the nodal basin decreased by 26%. \nRecurrences in the nodal basin were commonest in penile cancer (16.6%), while \nthose in the axilla (6.5%) could be salvaged surgically.\nCONCLUSION: Sentinel node biopsy can be safely performed even without a \nhand-held gamma probe, provided strict inclusion criteria, a double dye \ntechnique and a dedicated follow up regimen are adhered to.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain less clear. To reveal \nthe molecular mechanism by which lactic acid inhibits melanin synthesis through \nepigenetic pathways, proteins with significantly increased levels of lactylation \nmodifications after lactic acid addition were identified through HPLC-MS/MS. Key \ngenes affected by lactic acid addition were identified using ChIP-seq, and \nvalidated through qPCR and Western blot analyses. We reveal that lactic acid \ncould promote protein lactylation in a dose-dependent manner in B16 cells. \nHPLC-MS analysis revealed that histone H3 showed the most significant increase \nin lactylation following lactic acid treatment. Through ChIP-seq analysis, we \nobserved that lactylated histone H3 binding at the promoter region of the key \nmelanogenesis gene, Tyrp1, significantly decreased after lactic acid treatment. \nThis was accompanied by a notable reduction in Tyrp1 protein level. Our findings \nsuggest that protein lactylation play a crucial role in lactic acid induced \nmelanin synthesis inhibition.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Among patients with \nacral and mucosal melanoma, the cumulative 5-year incidence can reach 19.5%, \naccompanied by poor prognosis. The blood-brain barrier (BBB), an \nimmunosuppressive central nervous system (CNS) microenvironment, and tumor \nimmune evasion collectively limit the efficacy of traditional therapies. \nCytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death \nprotein 1 (PD-1), as critical immune checkpoints, play pivotal roles in the \nprogression of MBM. This study systematically analyzes the synergistic \nmechanisms, clinical outcomes, and challenges of CTLA-4 and PD-1 combined \nblockade therapy in MBM. The findings indicate that this combination therapy \nleverages a \"priming and boosting\" biological mechanism: CTLA-4 blockade \nbroadens T-cell responses during the initial activation phase, while PD-1 \nblockade sustains T-cell activity during the effector phase, significantly \nimproving intracranial response rates (46%, compared to 20% for monotherapy). \nFurthermore, the combination therapy increases the CD8+/Treg ratio and promotes \nmemory CD8+ T-cell formation, enabling durable antitumor immune surveillance. \nHowever, challenges such as a 54% incidence rate of grade 3-4 adverse events and \nsuboptimal therapeutic regimens remain.

On physical examination \nabdominal masses and hepatomegaly were detected. Radiological imaging showed \nwidespread masses in the abdominal and thoracic regions. Upper gastrointestinal \nendoscopy identified an umbilicated protruded lesion with central dark \npigmentation at the antro-fundic junction. Histopathological examination and \nimmunohistochemical staining were consistent with melanoma. A subsequent \nrigorous skin examination uncovered a primary malignant skin melanoma. Due to \nworsening general condition, the patient received palliative hospice care.\nCONCLUSION: This report highlights the critical need for vigilant skin \nexamination when encountering gastric lesions with dark pigmentation, which led \nto the identification of initially undetected cutaneous melanoma.\n\nCopyright: \u00a9 2024 Tababi R et al.\n\nDOI: 10.12688/f1000research.155815.2\nPMCID: PMC12260486\nPMID: 40666159 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: No competing interests were disclosed.\n\n\n29.

Liver-directed therapies (LDT) are commonly used given the \nstrong predilection for hepatic metastases. Transarterial immunoembolization \n(TAIE) with granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) can \npotentially synergize with concurrent systemic\u00a0ICI to overcome immune evasion.\nMETHODS: This single-center, retrospective study includes mUM patients with \nliver-predominant metastases who received TAIE, with/without concurrent \nsystemic\u00a0ICI (\u2264\u20093\u00a0months before/during TAIE). Endpoints included ORR, \nprogression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse events \n(AEs).\nRESULTS: Between 2016 and 2023, 18 mUM patients (median age 64\u00a0years) received \nTAIE (median 4 procedures/patient). Fourteen patients (78%) received concurrent \nICI. ORR was 17% (3/18), all in patients receiving ICI, with partial responses \nlasting 4.2, 35\u2009+\u2009and 46\u00a0months. Disease control rate (stable disease or better) \nwas 56% (10/18). Median time to next systemic therapy or death was 19.5\u00a0months \n(range 1.6- 46). Median PFS and OS from first TAIE treatment were 4.9\u00a0months \n(range 0.7-46) and 35\u00a0months (range 1.7- 46). Immune-related AEs (IRAE) during \nconcurrent therapy occurred in seven of 10 patients receiving anti-CTLA-4/PD-1 \ncombination, including hepatitis (n\u2009=\u20095; grade 2 in 1, grade 3 in 4). Four of \nseven patients resumed anti-PD-1 monotherapy without recurrent IRAE.\nCONCLUSIONS: Concurrent LDT with GM-CSF TAIE and ICI, including anti-CTLA-4/PD-1 \ncombination, is feasible, safe, and can lead to sustained clinical benefit in a \nsubset of mUM patients. OS with this combination compares favorably to published \noutcomes for systemic therapy or LDT alone.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

However, its function in skin \ncutaneous melanoma (SKCM) is largely unknown and urgently needs to be explored. \nAnalysis of a publicly available database revealed that TNFAIP2 was \nsignificantly downregulated in SKCM tissues vs. normal controls (P\u2009<\u20090.001) and \nthat its expression was a significant indicator for SKCM diagnosis \n(AUC\u2009=\u20090.742). Patients with low TNFAIP2 expression tended to have tumors in \nadvanced clinical stages with a poor prognosis (P\u2009<\u20090.01), which was validated \nin our cohort. Subsequent enrichment analysis revealed that genes differentially \nexpressed between SKCM tissues with high and low TNFAIP2 expression were highly \nenriched in with multiple tumor immune signatures, especially immune checkpoint \nsignalling. Immune infiltration estimation indicated that TNFAIP2 upregulation \npredicated increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells, B cells, NK cells, and M1 \nmacrophages and predicted a favourable response to immune checkpoint blockade \n(ICB) treatment in SKCM. In the SKCM mouse model, TNFAIP2 overexpression \nsuppressed tumor growth and lung metastasis, and this effect was even more \npronounced in immunocompetent mice; notably, these mice presented increased \ninfiltration of CD8+ T cells and M1 macrophages into the tumor microenvironment. \nMoreover, TNFAIP2 overexpression clearly increased the sensitivity of SKCM to \nanti-PD-1 immunotherapy. The above results indicate the tumor-suppressive role \nof TNFAIP2, which may be a promising target for improving the efficacy of ICB \ntreatment in SKCM.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

However, their role in \nacral melanoma (AM) has not been previously explored.\nMETHODS: We characterized the mycobiome in AM tumor tissues and adjacent \nnon-tumor tissues. Differences in fungal communities between the two tissues, as \nwell as the prognostic and diagnostic potential of intratumoral fungi, and their \nassociations with the tumor microenvironment and clinicopathologic features, \nwere evaluated through bioinformatics and biostatistical analyses.\nRESULTS: Although some intratumoral fungi originated from adjacent tissues, AM \ntumors exhibited a distinct fungal composition characterized by altered species \nrichness, community structure, and an increased Ascomycota-to-Basidiomycota \nratio. Several fungal taxa were identified as potential diagnostic and \nprognostic biomarkers and showed significant correlations with clinical \nparameters and immune infiltration. Specifically, the CD68-high samples harbored \ngreater fungal diversity and higher relative abundance of Endocarpon compared \nwith CD68-low samples. Furthermore, fungi-bacteria interactions were \ncharacterized by significant negative correlations between their diversity, \nwhile positive interspecies interactions dominated the network.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the potential role of the cancer \nmycobiome in AM and offer new insights into the tumor microenvironment and its \nimplications for cancer prevention and therapy.\n\n\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

This research aims to \nexplore the potential efficacy of APOL3 in melanoma. Using data from the Cancer \nGenome Atlas-Skin Cutaneous Melanoma (TCGA-SKCM), we identified two clusters \nbased on 56 prognostic antigen presentation-related genes. Differential \nexpression analysis revealed 185 genes between these two clusters, which were \nfurther narrowed down to 34 genes using univariate analysis and random survival \nforest dimensionality reduction. Among them, APOL3 was found to be the \ntop-ranked gene. Afterward, the effect of APOL3 on melanoma cells was evaluated \nusing CCK-8, EdU, and Transwell experiment. The results showed that \noverexpression of APOL3 decreases melanoma cell viability, clonogenicity, \nproliferation, migration, and invasion. Bioinformatics analysis showed the \nassociation of high/low APOL3 expression with genomic mutations characterizing \nmelanoma. APOL3 was also found associated with T-cell infiltration levels, \nimmune checkpoints (CD274, PDCD1, CD247, PDCD1LG2, CTLA4, TNFRSF9, TNFRSF4, and \nTLR9), and some immune pathways. To validate the role of APOL3 on T cell \nimmunity, we applied B16 melanoma cells to construct the mice tumor models. The \nmodel showed that APOL3 overexpression markedly reduces melanoma tumor volume \nand weight while increasing interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), granzyme B production, and \nCD3+ T cell infiltration. In conclusion, antigen presentation-related APOL3 \npromotes anti-tumor T-cell immunity and suppresses melanoma cell growth in-vitro \nand in-vivo in a murine model. These results suggested that APOL3 may serve as a \npromising immunotherapeutic target for the treatment of melanoma.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/08916934.2025.2531833\nPMID: 40662475 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n33.

Here, we comprehensively \ninvestigated the causal effect of blood cells on skin cancer subtypes across 4 \ndifferent human microenvironments through 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) \nanalysis and mediation analysis. Summary statistics of 91 human blood cells, 233 \ncirculating metabolites, 731 immune cells, 46 antibody immune responses, 91 \ninflammatory cytokines, and 4 skin cancer traits (including cutaneous melanoma, \nnonmelanoma skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma) were \nderived from genome-wide association studies. The bidirectional 2-sample MR was \nused to determine the causality between exposures and outcomes. Additionally, \ncomprehensive sensitivity analyses were performed to ensure the robustness of MR \nfindings. Finally, the mediation analysis was applied to identify the role of \nblood cells in skin cancers mediated by 4 different microenvironments. MR \nrevealed causal associations between 18 different types of human blood cells, 30 \ndifferent types of circulating metabolites, 136 different types of immune cells, \n17 different types of antibodies immune responses, 17 different types of \ninflammatory cytokines with skin cancers. Reverse MR analysis indicated skin \ncancers were causally associated with the levels of 4 different types of human \nblood cells. Mediation analysis revealed 19 mediation correlations during the \ncausal effect from blood cells to skin cancers. Among them, 13 belonged to \nimmune cells, 3 belonged to inflammatory cytokines, and 3 belonged to antibodies \nimmune responses. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the consistency of these \nfindings. This study represents the first comprehensive evaluation demonstrating \ncausal relationships among human blood cells, circulating metabolites, immune \ncells, antibodies immune responses, inflammatory cytokines, and skin cancers, \nthereby providing novel insights and potential intervention targets for skin \ncancer treatment.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 the Author(s).

Despite \nadvances in diagnostic tools and therapeutic approaches, the prognosis for \nmetastatic UM remains dismal, underlining the critical need for novel treatment \nregimens. Nanotechnology is an exciting new area in the treatment of UM that \noffers creative ways to get around the problems with current medicines. \nNanocarrier systems, including albumin-based nanoparticles, PEGylated \nnanostructured lipid carriers, nanostructured lipid carriers, and gold \nnanoparticles, facilitate targeted drug delivery, enhance bioavailability, and \nallow for controlled release. These advancements contribute to improved \ntherapeutic outcomes while simultaneously reducing off-target effects. Recent \nadvancements in nanotechnology have demonstrated considerable promise in the \nprevention of metastasis by facilitating early intervention and enabling the \ntargeted delivery of chemotherapeutic agents or immune modulators directly to \nthe tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, nanotechnology-based systems are being \ninvestigated for the delivery of RNA therapies and gene-editing tools, offering \na fresh approach to tackling the genetic foundations of UM. Preclinical and \nclinical investigations have shown encouraging results, with \nnanotechnology-enhanced medicines demonstrating higher effectiveness, lower \ntoxicity, and increased patient compliance. Recently, new ideas have been talked \nabout in this study, like theranostic systems and stimuli-responsive \nnanocarriers, which can do both diagnostic and medicinal work. This makes \npersonalized medicine possible in UM treatment. To summarize, nanotechnology has \nenormous potential for revolutionizing the therapeutic landscape for UM, \nespecially in terms of medication delivery and metastasis prevention. Further \nresearch and practical translation of these technologies are required to enhance \nUM patients' survival rates and quality of life.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

By \namplifying neural responses to chemicals such as histamine, OSM increases \nsensitivity to pruritus. However, the morphological effects of OSM on peripheral \nsensory nerves and their subsequent impact on pruritus remain unclear. This \nstudy investigated OSM-induced peripheral nerve elongation, which may contribute \nto skin hypersensitivity.\nMETHODS: We assessed neurite outgrowth using primary mouse dorsal root ganglion \n(DRG) cells treated with OSM, IL-31, or nerve growth factor. Next, we \npre-treated the cells with inhibitors of downstream signaling pathways of OSM, \nincluding extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), signal transducers and \nactivator of transcription (STAT) 3, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38, \nfollowed by OSM administration to measure neurite outgrowth. Furthermore, OSM \nreceptor \u03b2-overexpressing cell lines were established by gene transfer into the \nDRG cell line, and nerve elongation was measured after OSM administration. In \nvivo studies involved OSM administration in mouse skin models. \nImmunofluorescence staining was used to evaluate nerve elongation. We examined \nwhether OSM-infused mice had increased hypersensitivity to mechanical \nstimuli-induced pruritus. Various cytokine stimuli were applied to CD4+ T cells \nisolated from healthy humans to examine the conditions under which OSM \nproduction increases.\nRESULTS: OSM significantly induced neurite outgrowth in DRG cells and the effect \nof OSM surpassed the effects of IL-31 and nerve growth factor. The neurite \noutgrowth effect of OSM involved the JAK/STAT3, MEK/ERK, and p38/MAPK pathways. \nCompared to control cells, DRG cell lines that overexpressed OSM receptor \u03b2 \nshowed significantly enhanced neurite outgrowth upon OSM treatment. In vivo, OSM \ntreatment increased nerve elongation in the mouse dermis. Behavioral assays in \nmice showed that OSM administration increased sensitivity to mechanical stimuli. \nIL-4 and TNF\u03b1 increased OSM production in CD4+ T cells.\nCONCLUSION: OSM induces neurite elongation and may contribute to skin \nhypersensitivity. This suggests the potential utilization of OSM as a \ntherapeutic target for inflammatory skin diseases such as AD.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Ishikawa, Saito, Suehiro, Ishii, Yanase, Kawaguchi, Uchida, \nYanagida, Numata, Sasaki, Kamigaki, Takeno and Tanaka.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1571120\nPMCID: PMC12267034\nPMID: 40677708 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: AT has received speaker honoraria from Eli \nLilly, Kaken Pharmaceutical, Sanofi, Taiho Pharmaceutical, AbbVie, Pfizer, \nKyorin Pharmaceutical, Mitsubishi Tanabe, Torii Pharmaceutical, and Maruho, and \na research grant from Maruho.

Allergy outcomes at \n18\u2009months included parent-reported physician-diagnosed food allergy, \nparent-reported eczema and atopic eczema according to UK Working Party criteria, \nparent-reported ever wheeze, parent-reported physician-diagnosed asthma, and IgE \nsensitization to food and airborne allergens. Associations between maternal DII \nscores (continuous and quartiles) and allergic outcomes were assessed using \nlogistic regression, adjusting for maternal age, allergic heredity, farm living, \nregion of birth, siblings, and education.\nRESULTS: At age 18\u2009months, 4.9% of children had physician-diagnosed food \nallergy, 30.6% had eczema, 11.4% had atopic eczema, 15.9% reported ever wheeze, \n4.1% had physician-diagnosed asthma, and 19% were IgE sensitized. No significant \nassociations were found between maternal DII scores and the allergic outcomes of \ninterest.\nCONCLUSION: This large birth cohort study found no association between maternal \nDII during pregnancy and allergic diseases or IgE sensitization in 18-month-old \nchildren, suggesting that a proinflammatory diet during pregnancy does not \ninfluence early allergic outcomes. Further research is needed to clarify the \nrole of maternal diet in offspring immune development.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

However, the \nimplications of atopic dermatitis extend far beyond eczema itself. Increasing \nunderstanding of the disease has enabled a more accurate characterization of its \nburden, including structural and functional skin alterations as well as various \nsystemic comorbidities. This review examines the impact of the disease, \nbeginning with the neuroimmune pathways underlying pruritus and its psychosocial \nburden, and progressing to the current concepts surrounding the atopic march and \nthe broader spectrum of inflammatory or immune-mediated non-atopic \ncomorbidities, including the emerging discussion on its similarities and \ndifferences with psoriasis. Special attention has been given to literature \npublished from 2015 onwards. Ultimately, this review aims to deepen the \nunderstanding of the systemic nature of atopic dermatitis, providing a broader \nconceptual framework for assessing disease extent and severity.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Additionally, we performed histological and gene \nexpression analysis in lesional skin biopsies, assessed specific IgE levels in \nplasma, and together with the clinical features of the patients, were related to \nthe IL-22 in vitro response.\nRESULTS: HDM triggered heterogeneous IL-22 secretion in memory T cells, \npreferentially in the CLA+ subset, which enabled patient stratification into \nIL22 producers (IL22P, n=17) and non-producers (IL22NP, n=41). IL22P showed an \nincreased degree of epidermal thickness, overexpression of IL22 in lesional skin \nareas, elevated specific IgE levels against HDM and SEB in plasma, and a higher \nproinflammatory profile compared to IL22NP.\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first report showing that allergen-specific CLA+ \nT-cell-mediated IL-22 in vitro response functionally distinguish \nmoderate-to-severe adult AD patients with specific clinical features and \nactivated IL-22 pathway in their lesional skin, paving the way for the selection \nof patients that may benefit from IL-22-directed therapies.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Garc\u00eda-Jim\u00e9nez, Sans-de San Nicol\u00e0s, D\u00edez-Ribas, Curto-Barredo, \nBertol\u00edn-Colilla, Vivancos-Melench\u00f3n, Figueras-Nart, Bonfill-Ort\u00ed, Ryzhkova, \nFerran, Czarnowicki, Pujol and Santamaria-Bab\u00ed.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1599892\nPMCID: PMC12259416\nPMID: 40666509 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n40.

The objective \nof this study is to examine the association between FA and mental health in \nchildren and adolescents, compared to children and adolescents without FA \n(controls) and those with other chronic conditions but no history of FA. This is \na retrospective cohort study using IQVIA Medical Research Data from UK primary \ncare practices. Five cohorts of children aged 0-18 between 2000 and 2021 were \ndefined: FA, control, asthma, atopic dermatitis (AD), and type 1 diabetes (T1D). \nThe study included 1,130,721 children without FA (control), 23,263 with FA, \n136,453 with asthma, 207,575 with AD, and 4835 with T1D. Compared to control, FA \npatients had higher risks of eating disorders (hazard ratio (HR) 1.85, 95% CI \n1.42-2.41), anxiety (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.25-1.45), and depression (HR 1.24, 95% CI \n1.11-1.39). FA patients had lower depression risk than asthma and T1D patients \n(HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.68-0.87, 0.64, 95% CI 0.54-0.76, respectively) and lower \nanxiety risk than asthma patients (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79-0.91). FA patients' risk \nof eating disorders was not significantly different from asthma and T1D patients \n(HR 1.17, 95% CI 0.88-1.55, 1.58, 95% CI 0.81-3.10, respectively) but was \nsignificantly higher than in the AD group (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.07-1.90).\nCONCLUSION: This study indicates that children with FA face elevated risks of \nanxiety, depression, and eating disorders compared to children without FA, and \nthat these risks vary when compared to children with other chronic conditions. \nThese findings highlight the need for integrated mental health support in FA \nmanagement and greater awareness of FA's psychological impact among healthcare \nproviders.\nWHAT IS KNOWN: \u2022 Children with chronic illnesses such as asthma\u00a0and\u00a0diabetes are \nknown to have an elevated risk of mental health disorders. However, research on \nthe mental health impact of food allergies remains limited.\nWHAT IS NEW: \u2022 This study reveals that children with FA have significantly \nincreased risks of anxiety, depression, and eating disorders compared to \nchildren without FA and provides comparative insights into the mental health \nrisks of FA relative to other chronic conditions like asthma, atopic dermatitis, \ntype 1 diabetes, and healthy controls.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Emerging research \nsuggests a potential link between AD and neurodevelopmental disorders like \nattention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, there is a lack of \ncomprehensive studies within the Saudi Arabian population examining this \nassociation.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the prevalence of ADHD among patients \nwith AD in Saudi Arabia and to explore potential associations with demographic \nand clinical factors.\nMETHODS: In this cross-sectional, multicenter study conducted between May and \nNovember 2024, 419 patients with AD were recruited from various hospitals in \nSaudi Arabia. Children were screened for ADHD symptoms using the ADHD Rating \nScale-5, while adults were assessed with the Adult Self-Report Scale. Logistic \nregression was used to evaluate the influence of AD severity, age, gender, \nnationality, and BMI on the likelihood of ADHD symptoms.\nRESULTS: A total of 419 patients with AD were included, of whom 234 (55.8%) were \nchildren and 185 (44.2%) were adults; 239 (57%) were female and 360 (85.9%) were \nSaudi nationals. ADHD symptoms were identified in 84 (20%) patients, with a \nslightly higher prevalence among children (49/234, 20.9%) compared to adults \n(35/185, 18.9%; P=.61). No significant associations were found between ADHD \nsymptoms and gender, nationality, BMI, or AD severity in either age group. \nModerate to severe AD was more common among adults (48/185, 25.9%) than children \n(42/234, 17.9%; P=.048).\nCONCLUSIONS: This study found that 20% of patients with AD screened positive for \nADHD symptoms, with slightly higher rates in children than adults. No \nsignificant associations were observed between ADHD symptoms and gender, \nnationality, BMI, or AD severity. Although no significant clinical predictors \nwere identified, the findings emphasize the need for ADHD screening in patients \nwith AD, particularly in regions with high AD prevalence. Future longitudinal \nstudies should explore underlying mechanisms and assess how managing one \ncondition may influence the other.\n\n\u00a9 Amr Molla, Raed Jannadi, Dareen Hafez, Lujain Alrohaily, Ebtesam Abdullah, \nDuha Azouni, Muayad Albadrani.

The quantification of nocturnal scratching provides an objective \nmeasure, which could be used as a clinical trial endpoint tracking this \nAD-related behavior. However, it is not clear how digital health technologies \n(DHTs) intended to measure scratching perform in the real-world environment of \npatient homes.\nOBJECTIVE: In this study, we present the analytical validation of 2 DHTs: the \nGENEActiv wristband with Philips sleep and scratch algorithms (\"Philips\") and \nthe Emerald radio frequency touchless sensor (\"Emerald\") to measure nocturnal \nscratching in adults with AD.\nMETHODS: Thirty-one participants (15 with moderate AD, 11 with mild AD, and 5 \nhealthy volunteers) were enrolled in the study. Nocturnal scratching was \nassessed by each DHT in the study participant's home environment over a 4-week \nobservation period. Infrared videos were recorded during sleep twice per week \nand manually annotated for the intended sleep window (total sleep opportunity \n[TSO]) and scratching events. Human annotations for sleep and scratch measures \nwere used as a reference for comparison with DHTs (\"Reference\"). Estimated TSO \nwas compared for each DHT to Reference using Bland-Altman analysis. Within-night \nagreement of DHT-predicted scratching events versus the Reference was assessed \nby sensitivity, precision, and F1-score. Intraclass correlation was used to \ncompare night-level scratch summaries (scratch duration per hour of TSO and \nscratch frequency per hour of TSO) between each DHT and the Reference.\nRESULTS: Characterization of human-annotated scratching revealed a basal level \nof scratching in both healthy volunteers (13.1 seconds per hour) and in \nparticipants with AD on nights when no itch was reported (10.2 seconds per \nhour). The TSO window was quantified accurately with both DHTs having a mean \nbias compared with Reference of <30 minutes. The within-night agreement with \nreference to scratch detection performance resulted in F1-scores at the disease \ngroup level ranging from 0.51 to 0.68 for the Emerald DHT and 0.47 to 0.56 for \nthe Philips DHT. The night-level agreement of nocturnal scratch duration and \nfrequency with human raters fell mostly in the moderate-good range of intraclass \ncorrelation coefficients (0.5-0.9) in participants with AD and was not \nsignificantly lower than the level of agreement between any 2 human raters.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results support the analytical validity of both DHTs tested \nfor continuous measurement of nocturnal scratching in individuals with AD in the \nhome environment. Opportunities remain for improving the performance of the DHTs \ntested, especially in the precision of wrist-worn accelerometer scratch \ndetection, to reach human-level performance. Additional data collection in \ndiverse patient populations will be beneficial for practitioners intending to \nuse or improve these tools for quantifying nocturnal scratching behavior.\n\n\u00a9 Stefan Avey, Mark Morris, Davit Sargsyan, Molly V Lucas, Andrea O'Brisky, \nKenneth Mosca, Andrew Elias, Nicholas Fountoulakis, Mehdi Boukhechba, Xuen Hoong \nKok, Saiyam Jain, Mehrnoosh Oghbaie, Nikolay V Manyakov, Miao Wang, Zuleima \nAguilar, Lynn Yieh.

This study aims to evaluate DAR for EoE-tx using the FDA Adverse Event \nReporting System. FDA Adverse Event Reporting System was queried for DAR between \n2022Q1 and 2023Q4. Individual DARs (iDARs) were categorized and compared between \ntreatment groups: EoE, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and chronic rhinosinusitis \nwith nasal polyps. Logistic regression was used to predict serious DAR and \noutcomes, and zero-truncated negative binomial regression was used to predict \nthe number of iDAR. There were 51,000 DAR observations; 1459 for EoE-tx with 103 \n(7.1%) serious reactions and 44 (3.0%) serious outcomes including 3 deaths. For \nEoE-tx, the mean iDAR was 3.68 [3.51, 3.85], and the iDAR incidence rate ratio \namong men receiving EoE-tx was 0.73 [0.65, 0.83]. EoE-tx average iDAR primarily \nincluded general (0.75 [0.70, 0.80]), injection-site (0.69 [0.63, 0.74]), \ndermatologic (0.51 [0.46, 0.55]), and gastrointestinal (0.24 [0.21, 0.27]) \nreactions. Adults \u226550\u00a0years had 1.97 [1.28, 2.99] higher odds for serious DAR \ncompared to younger adults in EoE-tx. Overall, dupilumab demonstrated a \nfavorable safety profile across all indications, with low rates of serious \nadverse events. For EoE-tx specifically, higher total iDAR rates were observed, \ndriven largely by increased injection-site and gastrointestinal reactions \ncompared to other indications. Additionally, women exhibited higher iDAR rates \nthan men across all indications.\n\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2025.

It is \ncharacterized by recurrent eczematous lesions, intense pruritus, and disruption \nof the epidermal barrier. The pathogenesis of AD is multifactorial and involves \ncomplex interactions between genetic predisposition, environmental triggers, \nskin barrier defects, microbial dysbiosis, and immune dysregulation. While much \nof the research in recent decades has focused on the type 2 helper T cell \n(Th2)-driven adaptive immune responses that dominate the acute phase of the \ndisease, the role of innate immunity-particularly that of myeloid cells-has \nemerged as a crucial and underrated component in disease pathogenesis and \nprogression. This review highlights recent findings on the role of myeloid cells \nin the initiation, maintenance, and amplification of inflammation in AD. Myeloid \ncells respond to a wide range of environmental and tissue-derived triggers, \nincluding cytokines, alarmins, and microbial products. Upon activation, they \ncontribute to the inflammatory milieu by producing chemokines and cytokines, \npresenting antigens, and recruiting other immune cells to the skin. Importantly, \nmyeloid cells not only shape the local immune landscape but also engage in \ncrosstalk with keratinocytes and adaptive immune cells, thereby reinforcing \nchronic inflammation. In addition, the review outlines emerging therapeutic \nstrategies aimed at modulating myeloid cell function or selectively targeting \npro-inflammatory subsets. These approaches offer promising avenues that \ncomplement existing Th2-centered therapies, addressing disease mechanisms beyond \nthe adaptive immune response. A deeper understanding of the diverse and dynamic \nroles of myeloid cells in AD may thus support the development of more \ncomprehensive and personalized treatment strategies for long-term disease \ncontrol.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Kupschke and Schenk.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1608338\nPMCID: PMC12256259\nPMID: 40661941 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.

Abrocitinib, a selective Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) inhibitor, has \nshown promise in treating AD by targeting inflammatory pathways linked to \ndisease symptoms. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the \neffectiveness of abrocitinib in reducing lesion severity and pruritus in AD \npatients.\nMETHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane \nLibrary was conducted on September 19, 2024, following Preferred Reporting Items \nfor Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Included studies \nwere randomized controlled trials assessing abrocitinib's effects on lesion area \nand pruritus in AD patients. Data extraction and quality assessment were \nperformed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Statistical analyses, including \nmeta-regression and subgroup analysis, were conducted using Stata. Funnel plots \nwere examined to assess publication bias.\nRESULTS: Five studies met inclusion criteria, with sample sizes ranging from 267 \nto 837 participants. Abrocitinib significantly improved Investigator's Global \nAssessment (IGA) and Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75) scores, as well as \npruritus scores on the Pruritus Patient Numeric Rating Scale (PP-NRS), compared \nto placebo (all P\u2009<\u20090.001). A dose-response effect was observed, with higher \nefficacy at the 200\u00a0mg dose. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events \n(TEAEs) was higher in the intervention group, particularly at 200\u00a0mg, though no \nsignificant difference was noted in serious adverse events (SAEs) between \ngroups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Abrocitinib is effective in reducing lesion severity and pruritus \nin AD, with dose-dependent improvements. Despite a higher incidence of \nmanageable TEAEs at 200\u00a0mg, no significant increase in SAEs was observed, \nsupporting abrocitinib's safety and efficacy as a treatment for moderate to \nsevere AD.\nREGISTRATION: CRD420251056272.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

This paper highlights the skin's pivotal \ninvolvement in immunological mechanisms, showcasing its capacity to \nimmunomodulate by suppressing or potentiating the immune response. Previous \nfindings reveal that, in mice, epicutaneous (EC) immunization with an antigen, \neither alone or in conjunction with pathogen-associated molecular patterns \n(PAMPs), can suppress or potentiate immune responses, respectively. \nSpecifically, it was observed that EC immunization with an antigen can suppress \nimmune responses in various murine models of autoimmune diseases or allergic \ncontact dermatitis. The results indicate that EC immunization with an antigen \ncombined with PAMPs could serve as an effective strategy to boost immunity \nagainst pathogens or alleviate T helper type 2 lymphocyte (Th2)-dependent \nallergies. This protocol outlines a method for inducing skin suppression via the \nepicutaneous application of an antigen in a murine model of human allergic \ncontact dermatitis (ACD)-contact hypersensitivity (CHS) mediated by Th1 cells. \nHowever, it can also be applied to various murine disorder models. The article \npresents EC-induced immunomodulation as an attractive murine model for \nneedle-free immunotherapy across various disorders.\n\nDOI: 10.3791/67578\nPMID: 40658730 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"}
