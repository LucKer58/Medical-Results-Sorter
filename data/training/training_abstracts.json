stenosis. until 2021 there were no precision treatments available and in some countries elective surgery was considered a standard approach to increase height improve body proportions enhance functionality and correct deformities in a selected group of patients. recently ctype natriuretic peptide cnp has been explored as a potential treatment aiming to counteract the molecular activity driven by fgfr3. although postmarket and realworld data on the drug are still limited many questions remain about the potential for combining pharmacological and surgical therapies and how this might influence patient outcomes. concerns have also been raised regarding the potential impact of drugs on bone healing. however anecdotal evidence from orthopaedic practice suggests that the two ossification processes do not interfere with one another. the aim of this study was to describe the first realworld case series in which vosoritide treatment was integrated with limb surgery in children and adolescents with achondroplasia. results sixteen paediatric patients with molecular confirmation of achondroplasia were included in the study. all patients underwent combined vosoritide therapy and limb surgeries 13 for lower limb lengthening and 3 for varus correction through epiphysiodesis.the complementary roles of vosoritide therapy and surgery were highlighted with treatment outcomes aligning closely with expectations. conclusion this report provides the first clinical description of the combination of precision therapy with limb surgery in a relatively large multicentre cohort of paediatric patients with achondroplasia. these findings support continued exploration of the integration of different therapeutic approaches. 2025. the authors. doi 10.1186s13023025038537

dysfunctionassociated steatotic liver disease masld is a major cause of chronic liver disease. metabolic dysfunctionassociated steatohepatitis mash a progressive form of masld can lead to fibrosis and cirrhosis. the incidence and burden of mash in germany are expected to double by 2030 while diagnostic and management challenges persist. expert consensus on diagnostic strategies and treatment modalities in masld and mash is required. objectives the panel aimed to gather insights and consensus on the diagnostic pathway and current treatment modalities for mash in germany. methods a threeround webbased survey integrating delphi panel methodology with a standard survey was conducted from february to may 2024 to reach consensus on predefined questions. the survey involved 12 gastroenterology diabetology andor hepatology specialists in germany. results the delphi panel revealed that 75 of mash patients in germany remain undiagnosed. noninvasive measures such as fibrosis scores values from clinical and imaging tests to assess fibrosis liver enzyme tests and liver stiffness measurement were primary methods for diagnosing and monitoring mash patients. lifestyle modifications were the primary management strategy given the absence of approved pharmacological treatments for mash. the panel also highlighted significant challenges in managing mash including the lack of approved medications and the difficulty in sustaining lifestyle changes. conclusions the survey underscores the substantial underdiagnosis of mash and the reliance on noninvasive diagnostic

gastroenterology bsg clinical services and standards committee cssc has commissioned the bsg ibd section to update its guidelines last revised in 2019. these updated guidelines aim to complement the ibd standards and promote the use of the national primary care diagnostic pathway for lower gastrointestinal symptoms to enhance diagnostic accuracy and timeliness. formulated through a systematic and transparent process this document reflects a consensus of best practices based on current evidence. the guideline while developed primarily for the uk is structured to support ibd management internationally. it is endorsed by the bsg executive board and cssc without external commercial funding with involvement primarily supported through professional roles in public institutions and the national health service nhs. methodological revisions since the prior guidelines have enhanced rigor in technical review and development with methodology details published independently following peer review. in developing the recommendations 89 clinical experts and stakeholders participated in an online survey identifying primary outcomes such as clinical and endoscopic remission as well as adverse event metrics all stratified by clinically relevant effect sizes. these guidelines are intended to support clinical decisionmaking but are not prescriptive recognizing that individual clinical scenarios may warrant tailored approaches. further research may inform future revisions as new evidence emerges. authors or their employers 2025. reuse permitted under cc bync. no commercial reuse.

a prevalent symptom of the upper gastrointestinal tract causing health related consequences impacting quality of life and is associated with global economic burden. swallowing difficulties are classified into oropharyngeal dysphagia od and esophageal dysphagia. despite its clinical importance dysphagia is associated with several uncertainties regarding its optimal diagnostic workup and management particularly considering the progress with diagnostic modalities and technologies. a delphi consensus was performed with experts from various disciplines who conducted a literature summary and voting process on 41 statements. quality of evidence was evaluated using the grading of recommendations assessment development and evaluation criteria. consensus was reached for all the statements. the panel agreed with the definition and prevalence of esophageal and od types. the role of endoscopy highresolution manometry endoflip barium swallow and other imaging tests in evaluating esophageal dysphagia has reached overall strong agreement. videofluoroscopic swallow study alongside fiberendoscopic evaluation of swallowing as the methods of choice for the instrumental assessment of oropharyngeal dysfunction is a strong recommendation. regarding treatment a weak recommendation was achieved for the use of ppis calciumchannel blockers nitrates phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors antidepressants or peppermint oil for the treatment of hypercontractile esophagus. a strong recommendation exists for endoscopic and surgical treatment of achalasia while a weak recommendation is provided for other esophageal motility disorders. regarding od a weak recommendation was achieved for swallow therapy to improve swallowing mechanics reduce symptoms and enhance quality of life. swallow therapy could be more effective when using validated assessment tools consistent treatment parameters and considering longterm followup. a multinational group of european experts summarized the current state of consensus on the definition diagnosis and management of dysphagia. 2025 the authors. united european gastroenterology journal published by wiley periodicals llc on behalf of

earnosethroat specialists including respiratory physiotherapists and speech pathology specialists importantly a patient representative was also involved.compared with earlier versions we used a new methodology after discussion in the guidelines group we asked and answered the 12 most important and most frequent key questions regarding the clinical practice. the extent of the guideline could thus be significantly reduced.we added a short scientific background to each of the answers including the most recent references. the recommendations and statements were created in consensus and graded as strong or weak. if sufficient literature was not available we suggested discussing joint decisions with the patient.the 12 key questions are as follows key question 1 the classification of cough acute i. e. up to three weeks duration chronic i. e. after 8 weeks duration and subacute in between did not change but we added cough with or without expectoration as an additional classification aspect with therapeutic consequences. key question 2 acute and subacute cough are mostly but not exclusively due to the common cold. they are the first or second most frequent symptom prompting patients to seek medical or pharmacists care. antibiotic therapy is strongly discouraged for common cold key question 3 we defined red flags for mandatory immediate diagnostic for acute cough which usually does not require such diagnostic procedures key question 4 chronic cough overview of the most common causes for key question 5 cough in acute sarscov2 infection and in long covid key question 6 refractory

maternal hyperglycemia prior to and during pregnancy can reduce these risks. despite compelling evidence that preconception care pcc which includes achieving strict glycemic goals reduces the risk of congenital malformations and other adverse pregnancy outcomes only a minority of individuals receive pcc. suboptimal pregnancy outcomes demonstrated in realworld data highlight the need to further optimize prenatal glycemia. new evolving technology shows promise in helping to achieve that goal. dysglycemia is not the only driver of poor pregnancy outcomes in pdm. the increasing impact of obesity on pregnancy outcomes underscores the importance of optimal nutrition and management of insulin sensitizing medications during prenatal care for pdm. objective to provide recommendations for the care of individuals with pdm that lead to a reduction in maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes. methods the guideline development panel gdp composed of a multidisciplinary panel of clinical experts along with experts in guideline methodology and systematic literature review identified and prioritized 10 clinically relevant questions related to the care of individuals with diabetes before during and after pregnancy. the gdp prioritized randomized controlled trials rcts evaluating the effects of different interventions eg pcc nutrition treatment options delivery during the reproductive life cycle of individuals with diabetes including type 1 diabetes mellitus t1dm and type 2 diabetes mellitus t2dm. systematic reviews queried electronic databases for publications related to these 10 clinical questions. the grading of recommendations assessment development and evaluation grade methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and develop recommendations. the approach incorporated perspectives from 2 patient representatives and considered patient values costs and resources required acceptability and feasibility and impact on health equity of the proposed recommendations. results in individuals with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of becoming pregnant we suggest asking a screening question about pregnancy intention at every reproductive diabetes and primary care visit. screening for pregnancy intent is also suggested at urgent careemergency room visits when clinically appropriate 2 ooo. this was suggested based on indirect evidence demonstrating a strong association between pcc and both reduced glycated hemoglobin hba1c at the first prenatal visit and congenital malformations.in individuals with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of becoming pregnant we suggest use of contraception when pregnancy is not desired 2 oo. this was suggested based on indirect evidence in women with diabetes where pccincluding contraception as a key componentshowed a clinically significant association with improvements in firsttrimester hba1c and the rate of congenital malformations together with indirect evidence from the general population regarding the reduction of unplanned pregnancies and pregnancy terminations with the use of contraception.in individuals with t2dm we suggest discontinuation of glucagonlike peptide1 receptor agonist glp1ra before conception rather than discontinuation between the start of pregnancy and the end of the first trimester 2 ooo. this was suggested based on limited data on risk of exposure to glp1ra receptor agonists during pregnancy.in pregnant individuals with t2dm already on insulin we suggest against routine addition of metformin 2 ooo. this was suggested based on the gdp judgment that the benefit of adding metformin to insulin to achieve decrease in rates of large for gestational age infants did not outweigh the potential harm of increasing the risk of small for gestational age infants or adverse childhood outcomes related to changes in body composition.in individuals with pdm we suggest either a carbohydraterestricted diet 175 gday or usual diet 175 gday during pregnancy 2 ooo. this was suggested based on the gdp judgment that the available evidence was limited and very indirect resulting in significant uncertainty about the net benefits or harms. as such the evidence was insufficient to support a recommendation either for or against a carbohydrate intake cutoff of 175 gday.in pregnant individuals with t2dm we suggest either the use of a continuous glucose monitor cgm or selfmonitoring of blood glucose smbg 2 ooo. there is lack of direct evidence supporting superiority of cgm use over smbg for t2dm during pregnancy. there is indirect evidence supporting improved glucometrics with the use of cgm for individuals with t2dm outside of pregnancy substantial improvements in neonatal outcomes for individuals with t1dm using cgm during pregnancy and the potential for decreasing adverse pregnancy outcomes with improved glucometrics in individuals with t2dm.in individuals with pdm using a cgm we suggest against the use of a single 24hour cgm target 140 mgdl 7.8 mmoll in place of standardofcare pregnancy glucose targets of fasting 95 mgdl 5.3 mmoll 1hour postprandial 140 mgdl 7.8 mmoll and 2hour postprandial 120 mgdl 6.7 mmoll 2 ooo. this was suggested based on indirect evidence that associated adverse pregnancy outcomes with a fasting glucose 126 mgdl 7 mmoll.in individuals with t1dm who are pregnant we suggest the use of a hybrid closedloop pump pump adjusting automatically based on cgm rather than an insulin pump with cgm without an algorithm or multiple daily insulin injections with cgm 2 ooo. this was suggested based on a metaanalysis of rcts which demonstrated improvement in glucometrics with increased time in range md 3.81 ci 4.24 to 11.86 and reduced time below range md 0.85 ci 1.98 to 0.28 with the use of hybrid closedloop pump technology.in individuals with pdm we suggest early delivery based on risk assessment rather than expectant management 2 ooo. this was suggested based on indirect evidence that risks may outweigh benefits of expectant management beyond 38 weeks gestation and that risk assessment criteria may be useful to inform ideal delivery timing.in individuals with pdm including those with pregnancy loss or termination we suggest postpartum endocrine care diabetes management in addition to usual obstetric care 2 ooo. as the postpartum period frequently overlaps with preconception this was suggested based on indirect evidence demonstrating a strong association between pcc and both reduced hba1c at the first prenatal visit and congenital malformations. conclusion the data supporting these recommendations were of very low to low certainty highlighting the urgent need for research designed to provide high certainty evidence to support the care of individuals with diabetes before during and after pregnancy. investment in implementation science for pcc is crucial to prevent significant mortality and morbidity for individuals with pdm and their children. rcts to further define glycemic targets in pregnancy and refinement of emerging technology to achieve those targets can lead to significant reduction of harm and in the burden of diabetes care. data on optimal nutrition and obesity management in pregnancy are lacking. more research on timing of delivery in women with pdm is also needed. this article has been copublished with permission in european

nephrologists revealed heterogeneous biomarker availability and varied treatment approaches. denosumab was the preferred antiresorptive agent while anabolic drugs were rarely used. findings highlight progress in ckdrelated bone health management despite existing uncertainties. ckdassociated osteoporosis comprises the skeletal effects of a complex mineral and bone disorder causing increased risks of fragility fractures ff cardiovascular events and mortality. existing clinical guidance about ckdassociated osteoporosis is vague leading us to hypothesize that a treatment gap exists and that clinical practice is dependent on local availability of diagnostic tools. purpose and methods the aim of the current survey was to determine current attitudes and practices among italian nephrologists regarding the evaluation and management of ckdassociated osteoporosis. an online survey was designed consisting of 9 thematic groups with a set of 16 closed questions regarding the availability of biomarkers and btms at reference laboratories and their use for the diagnosis and treatment of ckdassociated osteoporosis in patients with different stages of ckd including ckd stages g45 and dialysis patients. results were compared to a previous survey on the use of btms from 2022. results eightynine italian nephrologists participated in the survey reporting that parathyroid hormone pth alkaline phosphatase and 25hydroxyvitamin d measurements were available in 92100 of their reference laboratories. measurements for fibroblast growth factor23 klotho matrix gla protein procollagen type 1 nterminal propeptide and tartrateresistant acid phosphatase 5b were available in 6474 of cases. regarding pth cutoff values 47.2 followed kdoqi and 43.8 followed kdigo recommendations. vitamin d was widely used across ckd stages cholecalciferol 2737.1 calcifediol 912.4 calcitriol 47.253.9 and paricalcitol 21.330.3. denosumab was the preferred antiresorptive agent in all ckd stages 22.528.1 while the use of bisphosphonates was uncommon in advanced ckd. anabolic drugs were rarely prescribed. conclusions the availability of bone biomarkers is heterogeneous and an uncertainty still exists regarding the clinical use of biomarkers in ckdassociated osteoporosis. nonetheless our findings indicate that italian nephrologists are increasingly taking proactive steps to prevent and treat bone fragility in ckd patients. 2025. the authors under exclusive licence to the international osteoporosis foundation and the bone health and osteoporosis foundation. doi 10.1007s1165702501570z pmid

pregnancy loss epl prediction but there are inevitable intraobserver and interobserver errors in bultrasound results especially in early pregnancy which lead to inconsistent assessment of embryonic status and thus affect the judgment of epl. to address this we need a rapid and accurate model to predict pregnancy loss in the first trimester. this study aimed to construct an artificial intelligence model to automatically extract biometric parameters from ultrasound videos of early embryos and predict pregnancy loss. this can effectively eliminate the measurement error of bultrasound results accurately predict epl and provide decision support for doctors with relatively little clinical experience. a total of 630 ultrasound videos from women with early singleton pregnancies of gestational age between 6 and 10 weeks were used for training. a twostage artificial intelligence model was established. first some biometric parameters such as gestational sac areas gsa yolk sac diameter ysd crown rump length crl and fetal heart rate fhr were extract from ultrasound videos by a deep neural network named a3fnet which is a modified neural network based on unet designed by ourselves. then an ensemble learning model predicted pregnancy loss risk based on these features. dice iou and precision were used to evaluate the measurement results and sensitivity auc etc. were used to evaluate the predict results. the fetal heart rate was compared with those measured by doctors and the accuracy of results was compared with other ai models. in the biometric features measurement stage the precision of gsa ysd and crl of a3fnet were 98.64 96.94 and 92.83 it was the highest compared to other 2 models. blandaltman analysis did not show systematic deviations between doctors and ai. the mean and standard deviation of the mean relative error between doctors and the ai model was 0.060 0.057. in the epl prediction stage the ensemble learning models demonstrated excellent performance with catboost being the bestperforming model achieving a precision of 98.0 and an auc of 0.969 95 ci 0.9620.975. in this study a hybrid ai model to predict epl was established. first a deep neural network automatically measured the biometric parameters from ultrasound video to ensure the consistency and accuracy of the measurements then a machine learning model predicted epl risk to support doctors making decisions. the use of our established ai model in epl prediction has the potential to assist physicians in making more accurate and timely clinical decision in clinical

dog. braun mn1 michael t2 equit m2 lasshennemann j2. author information 1department of psychology saarland university saarbrcken germany moritz.braununisaarland.de moritz.nicolai.braungmail.com. 2department of psychology saarland university saarbrcken germany. introduction exposure is a central component in the treatment of a range of mental disorders. however despite high efficacy and efficiency dissemination of exposurebased treatments is limited. important factors that contribute to this limited dissemination are negative beliefs about exposure on the part of the public the therapists and the patients. while patients perceive exposure therapy as burdensome therapists are concerned about putting too much strain on their patients during exposure leading to suboptimal delivery of exposure. in a previous study in which healthy participants underwent a differential fear conditioning paradigm we found initial evidence that the integration of a therapy dog into exposure reduces participants anxiety and increases participants positive affect without causing poor treatment outcome. thus the integration of a therapy dog into exposure might be a promising approach to address patients and therapists concerns and thus to 1 foster dissemination of exposure that is 2 delivered in an optimal manner. to scrutinise our findings in a clinical sample we designed the present study. we test the following hypotheses h1 participants in the dog group report significantly less anxiety during the course of the treatment than participants in the control group. h2 participants in the dog group report significantly more positive affect during the course of the treatment than participants in the control group. h3 participants in the dog group report significantly higher therapy motivation than participants in the control group. h4 participants in the dog group report significantly lower anticipatory anxiety than participants in the control group. h5 the treatment in the dog group is not inferior to the treatment in the control group. methods and analysis in this parallel randomised controlled trial of two groups n88 participants spider phobics without a current diagnosis of a mental disorder other than a specific phobia insect bite allergy dog hair allergy fear of dogs current psychopharmacological treatment and current psychotherapeutic treatment the sample size calculation is based on the results from our previous study are randomly allocated with a 11 allocation as per a computergenerated randomisation schedule to either an ambulant onesession in vivo exposure treatment of spider phobia with a therapy dog dog group or without a dog control group. due to the nature of the intervention neither participants nor therapists can be blinded once participants are allocated to one of the two groups. however the person conducting screening and diagnostics is blind to the allocation participants are blind to the hypotheses and the respective other group and the researchers are blind to the allocation while analysing the data. we will test h1 and h2 concerned with our primary outcomes by means of 24 mixed analyses of variance with the betweensubjects factor group dog group vs. control group the withinsubjects factor time with four levels one for each time point anxiety and affect are measured during treatment and

moxibustion at feishu bl13 on immunoinflammatory response in rats with allergic rhinitis ar based on phosphatidylinositol 3kinase pi3kprotein kinase b akt signaling pathway so as to explore its underlying mechanism. methods thirtytwo male sd rats were randomly divided into a blank group 6 rats and a modeling group 26 rats. in the modeling group ar model was prepared using systemic and local attack sensitization method with ovalbumin. the successfullymodeled rats were randomized into a model group 6 rats a medication group 6 rats and a moxibustion group 14 rats. in the moxibustion group the suspending moxibustion was operated at bilateral feishu bl13 40 min each time once daily for 21 consecutive days during which the temperature of the body and tail was recorded. during intervention if the temperature of the body and tail increased by 1 the heatsensitive reaction at the point was determined in the rats of the moxibustion group and these rats were collected in a heatsensitive moxibustion group 8 rats involved and 6 rats of them were randomly collected to ensure the samplesize consistency and those without heatsensitive moxibustion reaction were assigned to a traditional moxibustion group 6 rats. in the medication group fluticasone propionate nasal spray was applied 8 l on each side once daily and for 21 days. the behavioral score for ar symptoms after modeling and intervention and the content of serum immunoglobulin e ige after modeling were observed. after intervention the histological morphology of the nasal mucosa was observed using he staining the positive expression of thymic stromal lymphopoietin tslp in the nasal mucosa was detected using immunohistochemistry the levels of ige interleukin il4 il5 il13 and interferon ifn were detected by elisa and the protein expression of the member 4 of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily ox40 phosphorylated protein kinase b pakt phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol 3kinase ppi3k in nasal mucosa was detected by western blotting. results after modeling the behavioral score of ar symptoms and serum ige level in the modeling group were higher than those of the blank group p0.01 suggesting the success of ar modeling. after intervention compared with the blank group the behavioral score of ar symptoms was increased p0.01the nasal mucosa structure was disordered the inflammatory infiltration
