breast and gastrointestinal including screening samples 207 34 breast 250 41 gastrointestinal. overall in light microscopy versus digital pathology comparisons clinical management concordance levels were 99.95 95 confidence interval 99.91 to 99.97. similar results were observed within specialties breast 99.40 95 confidence interval 99.06 to 99.62 gastrointestinal 99.96 95 confidence interval

pathology with familiarity. pathologists recorded high levels of confidence in their diagnosis with light microscopy significantly higher than digital pathology. limitations cytology cases and specialty groups outside those tested were not examined. the study used two digital pathology scanning systems. other systems available on the market were not tested. conclusions clinical management concordance levels between the two modalities exceed the reference 98.3 in breast gastrointestinal skin and renal specialties and pooled breast and large bowel cancer screening cases. subgroup analysis of clinically significant differences revealed a range of differences including areas where interobserver variability is known to be high which were distributed between reads performed with both platforms and without apparent trends to either. future work the use of digital pathology for cytology samples remains an area for further research. study registration this study is registered as
