methodology after discussion in the guidelines group we asked and answered the 12 most important and most frequent key questions regarding the clinical practice. the extent of the guideline could thus be significantly reduced.we added a short scientific background to each of the answers including the most recent references. the recommendations and statements were created in consensus and graded as strong or weak. if sufficient literature was not available we suggested discussing joint decisions with the patient.the 12 key questions are as follows key question 1 the classification of cough acute i. e. up to three weeks duration chronic i. e. after 8 weeks duration and subacute in between did not change but we added cough with or without expectoration as an additional classification aspect with therapeutic consequences. key question 2 acute and subacute cough are mostly but not exclusively due to the common cold. they are the first or second most frequent symptom prompting patients to seek medical or pharmacists care. antibiotic therapy is strongly discouraged for common cold key question 3 we defined red flags for mandatory immediate diagnostic for acute cough which usually does
