methods thirtytwo male sd rats were randomly divided into a blank group 6 rats and a modeling group 26 rats. in the modeling group ar model was prepared using systemic and local attack sensitization method with ovalbumin. the successfullymodeled rats were randomized into a model group 6 rats a medication group 6 rats and a moxibustion group 14 rats. in the moxibustion group the suspending moxibustion was operated at bilateral feishu bl13 40 min each time once daily for 21 consecutive days during which the temperature of the body and tail was recorded. during intervention if the temperature of the body and tail increased by 1 the heatsensitive reaction at the point was determined in the rats of the moxibustion group and these rats were collected in a heatsensitive moxibustion group 8 rats involved and 6 rats of them were randomly collected to ensure the samplesize consistency and those without heatsensitive moxibustion reaction were assigned to a traditional moxibustion group 6 rats. in the medication group fluticasone propionate nasal spray was applied 8 l on each side once daily and for 21 days. the behavioral score for ar symptoms after modeling and intervention and the content of serum immunoglobulin e ige after modeling were observed. after intervention the histological morphology of the nasal mucosa was observed using he staining the positive expression of thymic stromal lymphopoietin tslp in the nasal mucosa was detected using immunohistochemistry the levels of ige interleukin il4 il5 il13 and interferon ifn were detected by elisa and the protein

increased p0.05 in the medication traditional moxibustion and heatsensitive moxibustion groups. compared with the model group the protein expression of pakt was reduced in the medication and traditional moxibustion groups p0.05 the protein expression of ox40 pakt and ppi3k in the nasal mucosa decreased in the heatsensitive moxibustion group p0.05. when compared with the medication group the positive expression of tslp in the nasal mucosa was reduced p0.05 in the heatsensitive moxibustion group. in comparison with the traditional moxibustion group the content of serum il13 was reduced and the content of ifn elevated in the heatsensitive moxibustion and the medication groups p0.05 the protein expression of ppi3k reduced in the medication group p0.05 and the positive expression of tslp and the protein expression of ox40 and ppi3k in the nasal mucosa were reduced in the heatsensitive moxibustion group p0.05. conclusion heatsensitive moxibustion at feishu bl13 can alleviate the symptoms of ar rats ameliorate the inflammatory infiltration and telangiectasia of nasal mucosa and inhibit immunoinflammatory response which may be obtained by regulating pi3kakt signal pathway.

    "212579. mutants including its inferred unmutated common ancestor were characterized with respect to allergen affinity thermostability and hydrodynamic radius. results we demonstrate that even the antibodys inferred unmutated common ancestor shows high affinity for the allergen in the lownm range. glutamate at heavy chain position 38 a residue unique to allele ighv34803 the germline gene origin of the heavy chain of antibody 212579 was critical for high affinity binding. substitution to serine as found in other alleles of ighv348 reduced the affinity about 20fold. a substitution n40ht in the heavylight chain variable domain interface introduced into the antibody through somatic hypermutation did not impact its affinity for the allergen but reduced its thermal stability and increased its hydrodynamic radius. conclusion unmutated high affinity lownm antibodies specific for a major allergen phl p 5 can be generated directly in nave b cells and are given an appropriate rearrangement imprinted into the repertoire through rearrangements involving immunoglobulin germline gene alleles ighv34803 and igkv32001. this specificity depends on an alleleunique residue encoded by the immunoglobulin germline repertoire. substitutions in the heavylight chain variable domain interface such as n40ht in a heavy chain variable domain might negatively impact biophysical properties of the antibody and should be considered as targets for further evolution or reversion if they negatively impact an antibodys developability properties. copyright 2025 essn franciskovic sele godzwon and ohlin. doi 10.3389fimmu.2025.1600778 pmcid pmc12259648 pmid 40666503 indexed for medline conflict of interest statement the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.",
