nephrologists revealed heterogeneous biomarker availability and varied treatment approaches. denosumab was the preferred antiresorptive agent while anabolic drugs were rarely used. findings highlight progress in ckdrelated bone health management despite existing uncertainties. ckdassociated osteoporosis comprises the skeletal effects of a complex mineral and bone disorder causing increased risks of fragility fractures ff cardiovascular events and mortality. existing clinical guidance about ckdassociated osteoporosis is vague leading us to hypothesize that a treatment gap exists and that clinical practice is dependent on local availability of diagnostic tools. purpose and methods the aim of the current survey was to determine current attitudes and practices among italian nephrologists regarding the evaluation and management of ckdassociated osteoporosis. an online survey was designed consisting of 9 thematic groups with a set of 16 closed questions regarding the availability of biomarkers and btms at reference laboratories and their use for the diagnosis and treatment of ckdassociated osteoporosis in patients with different stages of ckd including ckd stages g45 and dialysis patients. results were compared to a previous survey on the use of btms from 2022. results eightynine italian nephrologists participated in the survey reporting that parathyroid hormone pth alkaline phosphatase and 25hydroxyvitamin d measurements were available in 92100 of their reference laboratories. measurements for fibroblast growth factor23 klotho matrix gla protein procollagen type 1 nterminal propeptide and tartrateresistant acid phosphatase 5b were available in 6474 of cases. regarding pth cutoff values 47.2 followed kdoqi and 43.8 followed kdigo recommendations. vitamin d was widely used across ckd stages cholecalciferol 2737.1 calcifediol 912.4 calcitriol 47.253.9 and paricalcitol 21.330.3. denosumab was the preferred antiresorptive agent in all ckd stages 22.528.1 while the use of bisphosphonates was uncommon in advanced ckd. anabolic drugs were rarely prescribed. conclusions the availability of bone biomarkers is heterogeneous and an uncertainty still exists regarding the clinical use of biomarkers in ckdassociated osteoporosis. nonetheless our findings indicate that italian nephrologists are increasingly taking proactive steps to prevent and treat bone fragility in ckd patients. 2025. the authors under exclusive licence to the international osteoporosis foundation and the bone health and osteoporosis foundation. doi 10.1007s1165702501570z pmid
