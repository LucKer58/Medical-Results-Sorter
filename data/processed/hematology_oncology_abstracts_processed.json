on treatment of pediatric venous thromboembolism vte were published in 2018. in the last 6 years there has been a 10fold increase in the number of children involved in vte treatment trials. objective the ash committee on quality and guidelines agreed to update the pediatric guidelines in conjunction with the international society on thrombosis and haemostasis isth. these ashisth evidencebased guidelines are intended to support patients clinicians and other health care professionals in the management of pediatric patients with vte. methods ashisth formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. an unconflicted patient representative was not identified. the university of kansas health system supported the guideline development process updating or performing systematic evidence reviews up to 2024. the panel focused specifically on the 2018 questions for which there was the greatest amount of interim data. the panel used the grade grades of recommendation assessment development and evaluation approach including grade evidencetodecision frameworks to assess evidence and make recommendations which were subject to public comment. results the panel agreed on 20 recommendations and also provided implementation guidance on the optimal use of anticoagulants in pediatric patients. key recommendations of these guidelines include the role of doacs in the treatment of a variety of pediatric vtes. conclusions further research is required. key priorities are understanding the natural history of clinically unsuspected thrombosis across a range of patient subpopulations and obtaining realworld data on the use of doacs in children. 2025 american society of hematology. published by elsevier inc. licensed under creative commons
