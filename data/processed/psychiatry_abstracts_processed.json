psychology saarland university saarbrcken germany. introduction exposure is a central component in the treatment of a range of mental disorders. however despite high efficacy and efficiency dissemination of exposurebased treatments is limited. important factors that contribute to this limited dissemination are negative beliefs about exposure on the part of the public the therapists and the patients. while patients perceive exposure therapy as burdensome therapists are concerned about putting too much strain on their patients during exposure leading to suboptimal delivery of exposure. in a previous study in which healthy participants underwent a differential fear conditioning paradigm we found initial evidence that the integration of a therapy dog into exposure reduces participants anxiety and increases participants positive affect without causing poor treatment outcome. thus the integration of a therapy dog into exposure might be a promising approach to address patients and therapists concerns and thus to 1 foster dissemination of exposure that is 2 delivered in an optimal manner. to scrutinise our findings in a clinical sample we designed the present study. we test the following hypotheses h1 participants in the dog group report significantly less anxiety during the course of the treatment than participants in the control group. h2 participants in the dog group report significantly more positive affect during the course of the treatment than participants in the control group. h3 participants in the dog group report significantly higher therapy motivation than participants in the control group. h4 participants in the dog group report significantly lower anticipatory anxiety than participants in the control group. h5 the treatment in the dog group is not inferior to the treatment in the control group. methods and analysis in this parallel randomised controlled trial of two groups n88 participants spider phobics without a current diagnosis
