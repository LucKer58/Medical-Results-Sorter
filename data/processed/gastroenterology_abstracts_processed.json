dysfunctionassociated steatotic liver disease masld is a major cause of chronic liver disease. metabolic dysfunctionassociated steatohepatitis mash a progressive form of masld can lead to fibrosis and cirrhosis. the incidence and burden of mash in germany are expected to double by 2030 while diagnostic and management challenges persist. expert consensus on diagnostic strategies and treatment modalities in masld and mash is required. objectives the panel aimed to gather insights and consensus on the diagnostic pathway and current treatment modalities for mash in germany. methods a threeround webbased survey integrating delphi panel methodology with a standard survey was conducted from february to may 2024 to reach consensus on predefined questions. the survey involved 12 gastroenterology diabetology andor hepatology specialists in germany. results the delphi panel revealed that 75 of mash patients in germany remain undiagnosed. noninvasive measures such as fibrosis scores values from clinical and imaging tests to assess fibrosis liver enzyme tests and liver stiffness measurement were primary methods for diagnosing and monitoring mash patients. lifestyle modifications were the primary management strategy given the absence of approved pharmacological treatments for mash. the panel also highlighted significant challenges in managing mash including the lack of approved medications and the difficulty in sustaining lifestyle changes. conclusions the survey underscores the substantial underdiagnosis of mash and the reliance on noninvasive diagnostic methods in germany. the lack of approved treatments necessitates a focus on lifestyle modifications and comorbidity management. the delphi panels insights call for enhanced screening early detection and standardised algorithms to improve patient outcomes. 2025 the authors. liver international published by john wiley sons ltd. doi 10.1111liv.70225 pmcid pmc12266315 pmid 40668568 indexed for

gastroenterology bsg clinical services and standards committee cssc has commissioned the bsg ibd section to update its guidelines last revised in 2019. these updated guidelines aim to complement the ibd standards and promote the use of the national primary care diagnostic pathway for lower gastrointestinal symptoms to enhance diagnostic accuracy and timeliness. formulated through a systematic and transparent process this document reflects a consensus of best practices based on current evidence. the guideline while developed primarily for the uk is structured to support ibd management internationally. it is endorsed by the bsg executive board and cssc without external commercial funding with involvement primarily supported through professional roles in public institutions and the national health service nhs. methodological revisions since the prior guidelines have enhanced rigor in technical review and development with methodology details published independently following peer review. in developing the recommendations 89 clinical experts and stakeholders participated in an online survey identifying primary outcomes such as clinical and endoscopic remission as well as adverse event metrics all stratified by clinically relevant effect sizes. these guidelines are intended to support clinical decisionmaking but are not prescriptive recognizing that individual clinical scenarios may warrant tailored approaches. further research may inform future revisions as new evidence emerges. authors or their employers 2025. reuse permitted under cc bync. no commercial reuse.

a prevalent symptom of the upper gastrointestinal tract causing health related consequences impacting quality of life and is associated with global economic burden. swallowing difficulties are classified into oropharyngeal dysphagia od and esophageal dysphagia. despite its clinical importance dysphagia is associated with several uncertainties regarding its optimal diagnostic workup and management particularly considering the progress with diagnostic modalities and technologies. a delphi consensus was performed with experts from various disciplines who conducted a literature summary and voting process on 41 statements. quality of evidence was evaluated using the grading of recommendations assessment development and evaluation criteria. consensus was reached for all the statements. the panel agreed with the definition and prevalence of esophageal and od types. the role of endoscopy highresolution manometry endoflip barium swallow and other imaging tests in evaluating esophageal dysphagia has reached overall strong agreement. videofluoroscopic swallow study alongside fiberendoscopic evaluation of swallowing as the methods of choice for the instrumental assessment of oropharyngeal dysfunction is a strong recommendation. regarding treatment a weak recommendation was achieved for the use of ppis calciumchannel blockers nitrates phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors antidepressants or peppermint oil for the treatment of hypercontractile esophagus. a strong recommendation exists for endoscopic and surgical treatment of achalasia while a weak recommendation is provided for other esophageal motility disorders. regarding od a weak recommendation was achieved for swallow therapy to improve swallowing mechanics reduce symptoms and enhance quality of life. swallow therapy could be more effective when using validated assessment tools consistent treatment parameters and considering longterm followup. a multinational group of european experts summarized the current state of consensus on the definition diagnosis and management of dysphagia. 2025 the authors. united european gastroenterology journal published by wiley periodicals llc on behalf of
