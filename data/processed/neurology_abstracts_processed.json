young people and can occur during pregnancy. in women with prior cead it is unclear whether future pregnancies increase the risk of recurrent cead stroke or death. objective to compare the frequency of recurrent cead stroke or death as a composite outcome between patients with cead who became pregnant vs those who did not. design setting and participants the longterm risk of recurrent cervical artery dissection and stroke after pregnancy longrecap study was an international multicenter registrybased explorative cohort study with data from may 1 1990 and april 30 2023 among patients with cead at 33 stroke centers across 9 countries who had at least 6 months of followup for whom detailed information was available on absence vs presence of subsequent pregnancies and the occurrence of outcome events. exposure pregnancy after cead. main outcomes and measures composite of recurrent cead stroke any type and death all causes during followup at least 6 months after initial cead. secondary outcomes were the components of the composite outcome. cox proportional hazards regression analysis with and without adjustment for age was used to examine the association between pregnancy and outcomes. results among 1013 female patients with cead median iqr age 42 3548 years 114 11.3 became pregnant during a median iqr followup of 5.3 2.011.3 years. the composite outcome occurred in 10 of 114 patients 8.8 including 7 patients with recurrent ceads 2 with ischemic strokes and 1 with intracerebral hemorrhage in the pregnancy group compared with 65 of 899 patients 7.2 including 32 with recurrent cead 26 with ischemic strokes 4 with intracerebral hemorrhages and 5 deaths 2 patients had 2 outcomes in the nonpregnancy group unadjusted hazard ratio 1.08 95 ci 0.562.08 ageadjusted hazard ratio 0.77 95 ci 0.381.56. five of 10 events in the pregnancy group occurred post partum 4 ceads and 1 stroke. ageadjusted hazard ratios for secondary outcomes were 1.03 95 ci 0.432.46 for recurrent cead 0.53 95 ci 0.132.12 for ischemic stroke 1.01 95 ci 0.119.32 for intracerebral hemorrhage and 0.90 95 ci 0.0324.88 for death. conclusions and relevance in this cohort study of women with a history of cead becoming pregnant was not associated with an increased risk of recurrent cead stroke or death. these findings may be helpful for individual counseling and family planning for women with prior cead. doi 10.1001jamanetworkopen.2025.21539 pmid 40674050 indexed for medline",
